"Araf","Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad. A Book revealed unto thee,- So let thy heart be oppressed no more by any difficulty on that account,- that with it thou mightest warn (the erring) and teach the Believers). Follow (O men!) the revelation given unto you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends or protectors, other than Him. Little it is ye remember of admonition. How many towns have We destroyed (for their sins)? Our punishment took them on a sudden by night or while they slept for their afternoon rest. When (thus) Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this: Indeed we did wrong. Then shall we question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom We sent it. And verily, We shall recount their whole story with knowledge, for We were never absent (at any time or place). The balance that day will be true (to nicety): those whose scale (of good) will be heavy, will prosper: Those whose scale will be light, will be their souls in perdition, for that they wrongfully treated Our signs. It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth, and provided you therein with means for the fulfilment of your life: small are the thanks that ye give! It is We Who created you and gave you shape; then We bade the angels prostrate to Adam, and they prostrate; not so Iblis; He refused to be of those who prostrate. (Allah) said: What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee? He said: I am better than he: Thou didst create me from fire, and him from clay. (Allah) said: Get thee down from this: it is not for thee to be arrogant here: get out, for thou art of the meanest (of creatures). He said: Give me respite till the day they are raised up. (Allah) said: Be thou among those who have respite. He said: Because thou hast thrown me out of the way, lo! I will lie in wait for them on thy straight way: Then will I assault them from before them and behind them, from their right and their left: Nor wilt thou find, in most of them, gratitude (for thy mercies). (Allah) said: Get out from this, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow thee,- Hell will I fill with you all. O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and enjoy (its good things) as ye wish: but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression. Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them, bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said: Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever. And he swore to them both, that he was their sincere adviser. So by deceit he brought about their fall: when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them: Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you? They said: Our Lord! We have wronged our own souls: If thou forgive us not and bestow not upon us Thy Mercy, we shall certainly be lost. (Allah) said: Get ye down. With enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood,- for a time. He said: Therein shall ye live, and therein shall ye die; but from it shall ye be taken out (at last). O ye Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame, as well as to be an adornment to you. But the raiment of righteousness,- that is the best. Such are among the Signs of Allah, that they may receive admonition! O ye Children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you, in the same manner as He got your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose their shame: for he and his tribe watch you from a position where ye cannot see them: We made the evil ones friends (only) to those without faith. When they do aught that is shameful, they say: We found our fathers doing so; and Allah commanded us thus: Say: Nay, Allah never commands what is shameful: do ye say of Allah what ye know not? Say: My Lord hath commanded justice; and that ye set your whole selves (to Him) at every time and place of prayer, and call upon Him, making your devotion sincere as in His sight: such as He created you in the beginning, so shall ye return. Some He hath guided: Others have (by their choice) deserved the loss of their way; in that they took the evil ones, in preference to Allah, for their friends and protectors, and think that they receive guidance. O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth not the wasters. Say: Who hath forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah, which He hath produced for His servants, and the things, clean and pure, (which He hath provided) for sustenance? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) purely for them on the Day of Judgment. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who understand. Say: the things that my Lord hath indeed forbidden are: shameful deeds, whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against truth or reason; assigning of partners to Allah, for which He hath given no authority; and saying things about Allah of which ye have no knowledge. To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation). O ye Children of Adam! whenever there come to you messengers from amongst you, rehearsing My signs unto you,- those who are righteous and mend (their lives),- on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve. But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance,- they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever). Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah? They will reply, They have left us in the lurch, And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected Allah. He will say: Enter ye in the company of the peoples who passed away before you - men and jinns, - into the Fire. Every time a new people enters, it curses its sister-people (that went before), until they follow each other, all into the Fire. Saith the last about the first: Our Lord! it is these that misled us: so give them a double penalty in the Fire. He will say: Doubled for all : but this ye do not understand. Then the first will say to the last: See then! No advantage have ye over us; so taste ye of the penalty for all that ye did ! To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin. For them there is Hell, as a couch (below) and folds and folds of covering above: such is Our requital of those who do wrong. But those who believe and work righteousness,- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear,- they will be Companions of the Garden, therein to dwell (for ever). And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury;- beneath them will be rivers flowing;- and they shall say: Praise be to Allah, who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of Allah: indeed it was the truth, that the messengers of our Lord brought unto us. And they shall hear the cry: Behold! the garden before you! Ye have been made its inheritors, for your deeds (of righteousness). The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire: We have indeed found the promises of our Lord to us true: Have you also found Your Lord´s promises true? They shall say, Yes; but a crier shall proclaim between them: The curse of Allah is on the wrong-doers;- Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: they were those who denied the Hereafter. Between them shall be a veil, and on the heights will be men who would know every one by his marks: they will call out to the Companions of the Garden, peace on you: they will not have entered, but they will have an assurance (thereof). When their eyes shall be turned towards the Companions of the Fire, they will say: Our Lord! send us not to the company of the wrong-doers. The men on the heights will call to certain men whom they will know from their marks, saying: Of what profit to you were your hoards and your arrogant ways? Behold! are these not the men whom you swore that Allah with His Mercy would never bless? Enter ye the Garden: no fear shall be on you, nor shall ye grieve. The Companions of the Fire will call to the Companions of the Garden: Pour down to us water or anything that Allah doth provide for your sustenance. They will say: Both these things hath Allah forbidden to those who rejected Him. Such as took their religion to be mere amusement and play, and were deceived by the life of the world. That day shall We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as they were wont to reject Our signs. For We had certainly sent unto them a Book, based on knowledge, which We explained in detail,- a guide and a mercy to all who believe. Do they just wait for the final fulfilment of the event? On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true (tidings). Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? then should we behave differently from our behaviour in the past. In fact they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch. Your Guardian-Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne (of authority): He draweth the night as a veil o´er the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession: He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed be Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds! Call on your Lord with humility and in private: for Allah loveth not those who trespass beyond bounds. Do no mischief on the earth, after it hath been set in order, but call on Him with fear and longing (in your hearts): for the Mercy of Allah is (always) near to those who do good. It is He Who sendeth the winds like heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy: when they have carried the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to a land that is dead, make rain to descend thereon, and produce every kind of harvest therewith: thus shall We raise up the dead: perchance ye may remember. From the land that is clean and good, by the will of its Cherisher, springs up produce, (rich) after its kind: but from the land that is bad, springs up nothing but that which is niggardly: thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols) to those who are grateful. We sent Noah to his people. He said: O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day! The leaders of his people said: Ah! we see thee evidently wandering (in mind). He said: O my people! No wandering is there in my (mind): on the contrary I am a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds! I but fulfil towards you the duties of my Lord´s mission: Sincere is my advice to you, and I know from Allah something that ye know not. Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord, through a man of your own people, to warn you,- so that ye may fear Allah and haply receive His Mercy? But they rejected him, and We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark: but We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. They were indeed a blind people! To the ´Ad people, (We sent) Hud, one of their (own) brethren: He said: O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him will ye not fear (Allah)? The leaders of the Unbelievers among his people said: Ah! we see thou art an imbecile! and We think thou art a liar! He said: O my people! I am no imbecile, but (I am) a messenger from the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds! I but fulfil towards you the duties of my Lord´s mission: I am to you a sincere and trustworthy adviser. Do ye wonder that there hath come to you a message from your Lord through a man of your own people, to warn you? call in remembrance that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah, and gave you a stature tall among the nations. Call in remembrance the benefits (ye have received) from Allah: that so ye may prosper. They said: Comest thou to us, that we may worship Allah alone, and give up the cult of our fathers? bring us what thou threatenest us with, if so be that thou tellest the truth! He said: Punishment and wrath have already come upon you from your Lord: dispute ye with me over names which ye have devised - ye and your fathers,- without authority from Allah? then wait: I am amongst you, also waiting. We saved him and those who adhered to him. By Our mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe. To the Thamud people (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren: He said: O my people! worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! This she-camel of Allah is a Sign unto you: So leave her to graze in Allah´s earth, and let her come to no harm, or ye shall be seized with a grievous punishment. And remember how He made you inheritors after the ´Ad people and gave you habitations in the land: ye build for yourselves palaces and castles in (open) plains, and care out homes in the mountains; so bring to remembrance the benefits (ye have received) from Allah, and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth. The leaders of the arrogant party among his people said to those who were reckoned powerless - those among them who believed: know ye indeed that Salih is a messenger from his Lord? They said: We do indeed believe in the revelation which hath been sent through him. The Arrogant party said: For our part, we reject what ye believe in. Then they ham-strung the she-camel, and insolently defied the order of their Lord, saying: O Salih! bring about thy threats, if thou art a messenger (of Allah)! So the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes in the morning! So Salih left them, saying: O my people! I did indeed convey to you the message for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel, but ye love not good counsellors! We also (sent) Lut: He said to his people: Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you? For ye practise your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds. And his people gave no answer but this: they said, Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure! But we saved him and his family, except his wife: she was of those who legged behind. And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime! To the Madyan people We sent Shu´aib, one of their own brethren: he said: O my people! worship Allah; Ye have no other god but Him. Now hath come unto you a clear (Sign) from your Lord! Give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due; and do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order: that will be best for you, if ye have Faith. And squat not on every road, breathing threats, hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, and seeking in it something crooked; But remember how ye were little, and He gave you increase. And hold in your mind´s eye what was the end of those who did mischief. And if there is a party among you who believes in the message with which I have been sent, and a party which does not believe, hold yourselves in patience until Allah doth decide between us: for He is the best to decide. The leaders, the arrogant party among his people, said: O Shu´aib! we shall certainly drive thee out of our city - (thee) and those who believe with thee; or else ye (thou and they) shall have to return to our ways and religion. He said: What! even though we do detest (them)? We should indeed invent a lie against Allah, if we returned to your ways after Allah hath rescued us therefrom; nor could we by any manner of means return thereto unless it be as in the will and plan of Allah, Our Lord. Our Lord can reach out to the utmost recesses of things by His knowledge. In the Allah is our trust. our Lord! decide Thou between us and our people in truth, for Thou art the best to decide. The leaders, the unbelievers among his people, said: If ye follow Shu´aib, be sure then ye are ruined! But the earthquake took them unawares, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning! The men who reject Shu´aib became as if they had never been in the homes where they had flourished: the men who rejected Shu´aib - it was they who were ruined! So Shu´aib left them, saying: O my people! I did indeed convey to you the messages for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good counsel, but how shall I lament over a people who refuse to believe! Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We took up its people in suffering and adversity, in order that they might learn humility. Then We changed their suffering into prosperity, until they grew and multiplied, and began to say: Our fathers (too) were touched by suffering and affluence ... Behold! We called them to account of a sudden, while they realised not (their peril). If the people of the towns had but believed and feared Allah, We should indeed have opened out to them (All kinds of) blessings from heaven and earth; but they rejected (the truth), and We brought them to book for their misdeeds. Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our wrath by night while they were asleep? Or else did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played about (care-free)? Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allah?- but no one can feel secure from the Plan of Allah, except those (doomed) to ruin! To those who inherit the earth in succession to its (previous) possessors, is it not a guiding, (lesson) that, if We so willed, We could punish them (too) for their sins, and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear? Such were the towns whose story We (thus) relate unto thee: There came indeed to them their messengers with clear (signs): But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith. Most of them We found not men (true) to their covenant: but most of them We found rebellious and disobedient. Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them: So see what was the end of those who made mischief. Moses said: O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds,- One for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about Allah. Now have I come unto you (people), from your Lord, with a clear (Sign): So let the Children of Israel depart along with me. (Pharaoh) said: If indeed thou hast come with a Sign, show it forth,- if thou tellest the truth. Then (Moses) threw his rod, and behold! it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)! And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white to all beholders! Said the Chiefs of the people of Pharaoh: This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed. His plan is to get you out of your land: then what is it ye counsel? They said: Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while); and send to the cities men to collect- And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed. So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh: They said, of course we shall have a (suitable) reward if we win! He said: Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person). They said: O Moses! wilt thou throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw? Said Moses: Throw ye (first). So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic. We put it into Moses´s mind by inspiration: Throw (now) thy rod:and behold! it swallows up straight away all the falsehoods which they fake! Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. So the (great ones) were vanquished there and then, and were made to look small. But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration. Saying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,- The Lord of Moses and Aaron. Said Pharaoh: Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people: but soon shall ye know (the consequences). Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on apposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross. They said: For us, We are but sent back unto our Lord: But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the Signs of our Lord when they reached us! Our Lord! pour out on us patience and constancy, and take our souls unto thee as Muslims (who bow to thy will)! Said the chiefs of Pharaoh´s people: Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods? He said: Their male children will we slay; (only) their females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible. Said Moses to his people: Pray for help from Allah, and (wait) in patience and constancy: for the earth is Allah´s, to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is (best) for the righteous. They said: We have had (nothing but) trouble, both before and after thou camest to us. He said: It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may try you by your deeds. We punished the people of Pharaoh with years (of droughts) and shortness of crops; that they might receive admonition. But when good (times) came, they said, This is due to us; When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah´s sight, but most of them do not understand! They said (to Moses): Whatever be the Signs thou bringest, to work therewith thy sorcery on us, we shall never believe in thee. So We sent (plagues) on them: Wholesale death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, And Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance,- a people given to sin. Every time the penalty fell on them, they said: O Moses! on your behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove the penalty from us, we shall truly believe in thee, and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee. But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil,- Behold! they broke their word! So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them. And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of lands in both east and west, - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride). We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have. He said: Surely ye are a people without knowledge. As to these folk,- the cult they are in is (but) a fragment of a ruin, and vain is the (worship) which they practise. He said: Shall I seek for you a god other than the (true) Allah, when it is Allah Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations? And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh´s people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your females: in that was a momentous trial from your Lord. We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief. When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon thee. Allah said: By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me. When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe. (Allah) said: O Moses! I have chosen thee above (other) men, by the mission I (have given thee) and the words I (have spoken to thee): take then the (revelation) which I give thee, and be of those who give thanks. And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, (and said): Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked,- (How they lie desolate). Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them. Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter,- vain are their deeds: Can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought? The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image of calf, (for worship): it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong. When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be of those who perish. When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord? He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin. Moses prayed: O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy! Those who took the calf (for worship) will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those who invent (falsehoods). But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and (truly) believe,- verily thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing thereon was guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord. And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive. And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter: for we have turned unto Thee. He said: With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right, and practise regular charity, and those who believe in Our signs;- Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own (scriptures),- in the law and the Gospel;- for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honour him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him,- it is they who will prosper. Say: O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He That giveth both life and death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, who believeth in Allah and His words: follow him that (so) ye may be guided. Of the people of Moses there is a section who guide and do justice in the light of truth. We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: Strike the rock with thy staff: out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): Eat of the good things We have provided for you: (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls. And remember it was said to them: Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase (the portion of) those who do good. But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For that they repeatedly transgressed. Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression. When some of them said: Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?- said the preachers: To discharge our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him. When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression. When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: Be ye apes, despised and rejected. Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn (to us). After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world, saying (for excuse): (Everything) will be forgiven us. (Even so), if similar vanities came their way, they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will ye not understand? As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer,- never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish. When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein; perchance ye may fear Allah. When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves, (saying): Am I not your Lord (who cherishes and sustains you)?- They said: Yea! We do testify! (This), lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: Of this we were never mindful: Or lest ye should say: Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are (their) descendants after them: wilt Thou then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile? Thus do We explain the signs in detail; and perchance they may turn (unto Us). Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray. If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; So relate the story; perchance they may reflect. Evil as an example are people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls. Whom Allah doth guide,- he is on the right path: whom He rejects from His guidance,- such are the persons who perish. Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell: They have hearts wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle,- nay more misguided: for they are heedless (of warning). The most beautiful names belong to Allah: so call on him by them; but shun such men as use profanity in his names: for what they do, they will soon be requited. Of those We have created are people who direct (others) with truth. And dispense justice therewith. Those who reject Our signs, We shall gradually visit with punishment, in ways they perceive not; Respite will I grant unto them: for My scheme is strong (and unfailing). Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness: he is but a perspicuous warner. Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth and all that Allah hath created? (Do they not see) that it may well be that their terms is nigh drawing to an end? In what message after this will they then believe? To such as Allah rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide: He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction. They ask thee about the (final) Hour - when will be its appointed time? Say: The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (alone): None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only, all of a sudden will it come to you. They ask thee as if thou Wert eager in search thereof: Say: The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone), but most men know not. Say: I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as Allah willeth. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith. It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah their Lord, (saying): If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be grateful. But when He giveth them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received: but Allah is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him. Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created? No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves! If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace! Verily those whom ye call upon besides Allah are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are (indeed) truthful! Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: Call your ´god-partners´, scheme (your worst) against me, and give me no respite! For my Protector is Allah, Who revealed the Book (from time to time), and He will choose and befriend the righteous. But those ye call upon besides Him, are unable to help you, and indeed to help themselves. If thou callest them to guidance, they hear not. Thou wilt see them looking at thee, but they see not. Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant. If a suggestion from Satan assail thy (mind), seek refuge with Allah; for He heareth and knoweth (all things). Those who fear Allah, when a thought of evil from Satan assaults them, bring Allah to remembrance, when lo! they see (aright)! But their brethren (the evil ones) plunge them deeper into error, and never relax (their efforts). If thou bring them not a revelation, they say: Why hast thou not got it together? Say: I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord: this is (nothing but) lights from your Lord, and Guidance, and mercy, for any who have faith. When the Qur´an is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace: that ye may receive Mercy. And do thou (O reader!) Bring thy Lord to remembrance in thy (very) soul, with humility and in reverence, without loudness in words, in the mornings and evenings; and be not thou of those who are unheedful. Those who are near to thy Lord, disdain not to do Him worship: They celebrate His praises, and prostrate before Him. ",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Meryem","Kaf. Ha. Ya. ´Ain. Sad. (This is) a recital of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya. Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret, Praying: O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey: but never am I unblest, O my Lord, in my prayer to Thee! Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,- (One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased! (His prayer was answered): O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before. He said: O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age? He said: So (it will be) thy Lord saith, ´that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!´ (Zakariya) said: O my Lord! give me a Sign. Thy Sign, was the answer, Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb. So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allah´s praises in the morning and in the evening. (To his son came the command): O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might: and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth, And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout, And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious. So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)! Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. She said: I seek refuge from thee to (Allah) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah. He said: Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son. She said: How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste? He said: So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, ´that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us´:It is a matter (so) decreed. So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight! But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee. So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, ´I have vowed a fast to (Allah) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being´ At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought! O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste! But she pointed to the babe. They said: How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle? He said: I am indeed a servant of Allah: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet; And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live; (He) hath made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable; So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)! Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, Be, and it is. Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight. But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day! How plainly will they see and hear, the Day that they will appear before Us! but the unjust today are in error manifest! But warn them of the Day of Distress, when the matter will be determined: for (behold,) they are negligent and they do not believe! It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned. (Also mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham: He was a man of Truth, a prophet. Behold, he said to his father: O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing? O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight. O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (Allah) Most Gracious. O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (Allah) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend. (The father) replied: Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while! Abraham said: Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious. And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest. When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet. And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth. Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet. And we called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for mystic (converse). And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet. Also mention in the Book (the story of) Isma´il: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet. He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord. Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet: And We raised him to a lofty station. Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of (Allah) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears. But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,- Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,- Gardens of Eternity, those which (Allah) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass. They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening. Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil. (The angels say:) We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,- Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He? Man says: What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive? But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing? So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Evil Ones (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell; Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against (Allah) Most Gracious. And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein. Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished. But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees. When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, Which of the two sides is best in point of position? Which makes the best show in council? But how many (countless) generations before them have we destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye? Say: If any men go astray, (Allah) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of Allah (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realise who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces! And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return. Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children? Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with (Allah) Most Gracious? Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall add and add to his punishment. To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone. And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, to give them power and glory! Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them. Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers, to incite them with fury? So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days). The day We shall gather the righteous to (Allah) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours, And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water,- None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (Allah) Most Gracious. They say: (Allah) Most Gracious has begotten a son! Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous! At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, That they should invoke a son for (Allah) Most Gracious. For it is not consonant with the majesty of (Allah) Most Gracious that He should beget a son. Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (Allah) Most Gracious as a servant. He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly. And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment. On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (Allah) Most Gracious bestow love. So have We made the (Qur´an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention. But how many (countless) generations before them have We destroyed? Canst thou find a single one of them (now) or hear (so much as) a whisper of them? ",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Suara","Ta. Sin. Mim. These are verses of the Book that makes (things) clear. It may be thou frettest thy soul with grief, that they do not become Believers. If (such) were Our Will, We could send down to them from the sky a Sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility. But there comes not to them a newly-revealed Message from (Allah) Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom. They have indeed rejected (the Message): so they will know soon (enough) the truth of what they mocked at! Do they not look at the earth,- how many noble things of all kinds We have produced therein? Verily, in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily, thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. Behold, thy Lord called Moses: Go to the people of iniquity,- The people of the Pharaoh: will they not fear Allah? He said: O my Lord! I do fear that they will charge me with falsehood: My breast will be straitened. And my speech may not go (smoothly): so send unto Aaron. And (further), they have a charge of crime against me; and I fear they may slay me. Allah said: By no means! proceed then, both of you, with Our Signs; We are with you, and will listen (to your call). So go forth, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: ´We have been sent by the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds; ´Send thou with us the Children of Israel.´ (Pharaoh) said: Did we not cherish thee as a child among us, and didst thou not stay in our midst many years of thy life? And thou didst a deed of thine which (thou knowest) thou didst, and thou art an ungrateful (wretch)! Moses said: I did it then, when I was in error. So I fled from you (all) when I feared you; but my Lord has (since) invested me with judgment (and wisdom) and appointed me as one of the messengers. And this is the favour with which thou dost reproach me,- that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel! Pharaoh said: And what is the ´Lord and Cherisher of the worlds´? (Moses) said: The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- if ye want to be quite sure. (Pharaoh) said to those around: Did ye not listen (to what he says)? (Moses) said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning! (Pharaoh) said: Truly your messenger who has been sent to you is a veritable madman! (Moses) said: Lord of the East and the West, and all between! if ye only had sense! (Pharaoh) said: If thou dost put forward any god other than me, I will certainly put thee in prison! (Moses) said: Even if I showed you something clear (and) convincing? (Pharaoh) said: Show it then, if thou tellest the truth! So (Moses) threw his rod, and behold, it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)! And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders! (Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs around him: This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed: His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery; then what is it ye counsel? They said: Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while), and dispatch to the Cities heralds to collect- And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed. So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day well-known, And the people were told: Are ye (now) assembled?- That we may follow the sorcerers (in religion) if they win? So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: Of course - shall we have a (suitable) reward if we win? He said: Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person). Moses said to them: Throw ye - that which ye are about to throw! So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: By the might of Pharaoh, it is we who will certainly win! Then Moses threw his rod, when, behold, it straightway swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake! Then did the sorcerers fall down, prostrate in adoration, Saying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, The Lord of Moses and Aaron. Said (Pharaoh): Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? surely he is your leader, who has taught you sorcery! but soon shall ye know! Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross! They said: No matter! for us, we shall but return to our Lord! Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, that we may become foremost among the believers! By inspiration we told Moses: Travel by night with my servants; for surely ye shall be pursued. Then Pharaoh sent heralds to (all) the Cities, (Saying): These (Israelites) are but a small band, And they are raging furiously against us; But we are a multitude amply fore-warned. So We expelled them from gardens, springs, Treasures, and every kind of honourable position; Thus it was, but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things. So they pursued them at sunrise. And when the two bodies saw each other, the people of Moses said: We are sure to be overtaken. (Moses) said: By no means! my Lord is with me! Soon will He guide me! Then We told Moses by inspiration: Strike the sea with thy rod. So it divided, and each separate part became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain. And We made the other party approach thither. We delivered Moses and all who were with him; But We drowned the others. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. And rehearse to them (something of) Abraham´s story. Behold, he said to his father and his people: What worship ye? They said: We worship idols, and we remain constantly in attendance on them. He said: Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)? Or do you good or harm? They said: Nay, but we found our fathers doing thus (what we do). He said: Do ye then see whom ye have been worshipping,- Ye and your fathers before you?- For they are enemies to me; not so the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds; Who created me, and it is He Who guides me; Who gives me food and drink, And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me; Who will cause me to die, and then to life (again); And who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the day of Judgment. O my Lord! bestow wisdom on me, and join me with the righteous; Grant me honourable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations); Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss; Forgive my father, for that he is among those astray; And let me not be in disgrace on the Day when (men) will be raised up;- The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, But only he (will prosper) that brings to Allah a sound heart; To the righteous, the Garden will be brought near, And to those straying in Evil, the Fire will be placed in full view; And it shall be said to them: ´Where are the (gods) ye worshipped- ´Besides Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?´ Then they will be thrown headlong into the (Fire),- they and those straying in Evil, And the whole hosts of Iblis together. They will say there in their mutual bickerings: ´By Allah, we were truly in an error manifest, ´When we held you as equals with the Lord of the Worlds; ´And our seducers were only those who were steeped in guilt. ´Now, then, we have none to intercede (for us), ´Nor a single friend to feel (for us). ´Now if we only had a chance of return we shall truly be of those who believe!´ Verily in this is a Sign but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. The people of Noah rejected the messengers. Behold, their brother Noah said to them: Will ye not fear (Allah)? I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust: So fear Allah, and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds: So fear Allah, and obey me. They said: Shall we believe in thee when it is the meanest that follow thee? He said: And what do I know as to what they do? Their account is only with my Lord, if ye could (but) understand. I am not one to drive away those who believe. I am sent only to warn plainly in public. They said: If thou desist not, O Noah! thou shalt be stoned (to death). He said: O my Lord! truly my people have rejected me. Judge Thou, then, between me and them openly, and deliver me and those of the Believers who are with me. So We delivered him and those with him, in the Ark filled (with all creatures). Thereafter We drowned those who remained behind. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. The ´Ad (people) rejected the messengers. Behold, their brother Hud said to them: Will ye not fear (Allah)? I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust: So fear Allah and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Do ye build a landmark on every high place to amuse yourselves? And do ye get for yourselves fine buildings in the hope of living therein (for ever)? And when ye exert your strong hand, do ye do it like men of absolute power? Now fear Allah, and obey me. Yea, fear Him Who has bestowed on you freely all that ye know. Freely has He bestowed on you cattle and sons,- And Gardens and Springs. Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Great Day. They said: It is the same to us whether thou admonish us or be not among (our) admonishers! This is no other than a customary device of the ancients, And we are not the ones to receive Pains and Penalties! So they rejected him, and We destroyed them. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. The Thamud (people) rejected the messengers. Behold, their brother Salih said to them: Will you not fear (Allah)? I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust. So fear Allah, and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Will ye be left secure, in (the enjoyment of) all that ye have here?- Gardens and Springs, And corn-fields and date-palms with spathes near breaking (with the weight of fruit)? And ye carve houses out of (rocky) mountains with great skill. But fear Allah and obey me; And follow not the bidding of those who are extravagant,- Who make mischief in the land, and mend not (their ways). They said: Thou art only one of those bewitched! Thou art no more than a mortal like us: then bring us a Sign, if thou tellest the truth! He said: Here is a she-camel: she has a right of watering, and ye have a right of watering, (severally) on a day appointed. Touch her not with harm, lest the Penalty of a Great Day seize you. But they ham-strung her: then did they become full of regrets. But the Penalty seized them. Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. The people of Lut rejected the messengers. Behold, their brother Lut said to them: Will ye not fear (Allah)? I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust. So fear Allah and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the lord of the Worlds. Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing (all limits)! They said: If thou desist not, O Lut! thou wilt assuredly be cast out! He said: I do detest your doings. O my Lord! deliver me and my family from such things as they do! So We delivered him and his family,- all Except an old woman who lingered behind. But the rest We destroyed utterly. We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might Most Merciful. The Companions of the Wood rejected the messengers. Behold, Shu´aib said to them: Will ye not fear (Allah)? I am to you a messenger worthy of all trust. So fear Allah and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds. Give just measure, and cause no loss (to others by fraud). And weigh with scales true and upright. And withhold not things justly due to men, nor do evil in the land, working mischief. And fear Him Who created you and (who created) the generations before (you) They said: Thou art only one of those bewitched! Thou art no more than a mortal like us, and indeed we think thou art a liar! Now cause a piece of the sky to fall on us, if thou art truthful! He said: My Lord knows best what ye do. But they rejected him. Then the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them, and that was the Penalty of a Great Day. Verily in that is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds: With it came down the spirit of Faith and Truth- To thy heart and mind, that thou mayest admonish. In the perspicuous Arabic tongue. Without doubt it is (announced) in the mystic Books of former peoples. Is it not a Sign to them that the Learned of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)? Had We revealed it to any of the non-Arabs, And had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it. Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of the sinners. They will not believe in it until they see the grievous Penalty; But the (Penalty) will come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not; Then they will say: Shall we be respited? Do they then ask for Our Penalty to be hastened on? Seest thou? If We do let them enjoy (this life) for a few years, Yet there comes to them at length the (Punishment) which they were promised! It will profit them not that they enjoyed (this life)! Never did We destroy a population, but had its warners - By way of reminder; and We never are unjust. No evil ones have brought down this (Revelation): It would neither suit them nor would they be able (to produce it). Indeed they have been removed far from even (a chance of) hearing it. So call not on any other god with Allah, or thou wilt be among those under the Penalty. And admonish thy nearest kinsmen, And lower thy wing to the Believers who follow thee. Then if they disobey thee, say: I am free (of responsibility) for what ye do! And put thy trust on the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,- Who seeth thee standing forth (in prayer), And thy movements among those who prostrate themselves, For it is He Who heareth and knoweth all things. Shall I inform you, (O people!), on whom it is that the evil ones descend? They descend on every lying, wicked person, (Into whose ears) they pour hearsay vanities, and most of them are liars. And the Poets,- It is those straying in Evil, who follow them: Seest thou not that they wander distracted in every valley?- And that they say what they practise not?- Except those who believe, work righteousness, engage much in the remembrance of Allah, and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take! ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Zuhruf","Ha-Mim By the Book that makes things clear,- We have made it a Qur´an in Arabic, that ye may be able to understand (and learn wisdom). And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book, in Our Presence, high (in dignity), full of wisdom. Shall We then take away the Message from you and repel (you), for that ye are a people transgressing beyond bounds? But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old? And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him. So We destroyed (them)- stronger in power than these;- and (thus) has passed on the Parable of the peoples of old. If thou wert to question them, ´Who created the heavens and the earth?´ They would be sure to reply, ´they were created by (Him), the Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge´;- (Yea, the same that) has made for you the earth (like a carpet) spread out, and has made for you roads (and channels) therein, in order that ye may find guidance (on the way); That sends down (from time to time) rain from the sky in due measure;- and We raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised (from the dead);- That has created pairs in all things, and has made for you ships and cattle on which ye ride, In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated, ye may celebrate the (kind) favour of your Lord, and say, Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use), for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves), And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back! Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him (in his godhead)! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed! What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates, and granted to you sons for choice? When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (Allah) Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! Is then one brought up among trinkets, and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with Allah)? And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be called to account! (Ah!) they say, If it had been the will of (Allah) Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped such (deities)! Of that they have no knowledge! they do nothing but lie! What! have We given them a Book before this, to which they are holding fast? Nay! they say: We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps. Just in the same way, whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people, the wealthy ones among them said: We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we will certainly follow in their footsteps. He said: What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which ye found your fathers following? They said: For us, we deny that ye (prophets) are sent (on a mission at all). So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected (Truth)! Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: I do indeed clear myself of what ye worship: (I worship) only Him Who made me, and He will certainly guide me. And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him, that they may turn back (to Allah). Yea, I have given the good things of this life to these (men) and their fathers, until the Truth has come to them, and a messenger making things clear. But when the Truth came to them, they said: This is sorcery, and we do reject it. Also, they say: Why is not this Qur´an sent down to some leading man in either of the two (chief) cities? Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may command work from others. But the Mercy of thy Lord is better than the (wealth) which they amass. And were it not that (all) men might become of one (evil) way of life, We would provide, for everyone that blasphemes against (Allah) Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses and (silver) stair-ways on which to go up, And (silver) doors to their houses, and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline, And also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but conveniences of the present life: The Hereafter, in the sight of thy Lord is for the Righteous. If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of (Allah) Most Gracious, We appoint for him an evil one, to be an intimate companion to him. Such (evil ones) really hinder them from the Path, but they think that they are being guided aright! At length, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says (to his evil companion): Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West! Ah! evil is the companion (indeed)! When ye have done wrong, it will avail you nothing, that Day, that ye shall be partners in Punishment! Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or give direction to the blind or to such as (wander) in manifest error? Even if We take thee away, We shall be sure to exact retribution from them, Or We shall show thee that (accomplished) which We have promised them: for verily We shall prevail over them. So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on a Straight Way. The (Qur´an) is indeed the message, for thee and for thy people; and soon shall ye (all) be brought to account. And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee; did We appoint any deities other than (Allah) Most Gracious, to be worshipped? We did send Moses aforetime, with Our Signs, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: He said, I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds. But when he came to them with Our Signs, behold they ridiculed them. We showed them Sign after Sign, each greater than its fellow, and We seized them with Punishment, in order that they might turn (to Us). And they said, O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to His covenant with thee; for we shall truly accept guidance. But when We removed the Penalty from them, behold, they broke their word. And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying: O my people! Does not the dominion of Egypt belong to me, (witness) these streams flowing underneath my (palace)? What! see ye not then? Am I not better than this (Moses), who is a contemptible wretch and can scarcely express himself clearly? Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him, or (why) come (not) with him angels accompanying him in procession? Thus did he make fools of his people, and they obeyed him: truly were they a people rebellious (against Allah). When at length they provoked Us, We exacted retribution from them, and We drowned them all. And We made them (a people) of the Past and an Example to later ages. When (Jesus) the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy people raise a clamour thereat (in ridicule)! And they say, Are our gods best, or he? This they set forth to thee, only by way of disputation: yea, they are a contentious people. He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favour to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel. And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you, succeeding each other on the earth. And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way. Let not the Evil One hinder you: for he is to you an enemy avowed. When Jesus came with Clear Signs, he said: Now have I come to you with Wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) on which ye dispute: therefore fear Allah and obey me. For Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord: so worship ye Him: this is a Straight Way. But sects from among themselves fell into disagreement: then woe to the wrong-doers, from the Penalty of a Grievous Day! Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of a sudden, while they perceive not? Friends on that day will be foes, one to another,- except the Righteous. My devotees! no fear shall be on you that Day, nor shall ye grieve,- (Being) those who have believed in Our Signs and bowed (their wills to Ours) in Islam. Enter ye the Garden, ye and your wives, in (beauty and) rejoicing. To them will be passed round, dishes and goblets of gold: there will be there all that the souls could desire, all that their ayes could delight in: and ye shall abide therein (for eye). Such will be the Garden of which ye are made heirs for your (good) deeds (in life). Ye shall have therein abundance of fruit, from which ye shall have satisfaction. The sinners will be in the Punishment of Hell, to dwell therein (for aye): Nowise will the (Punishment) be lightened for them, and in despair will they be there overwhelmed. Nowise shall We be unjust to them: but it is they who have been unjust themselves. They will cry: O Malik! would that thy Lord put an end to us! He will say, Nay, but ye shall abide! Verily We have brought the Truth to you: but most of you have a hatred for Truth. What! have they settled some plan (among themselves)? But it is We Who settle things. Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed (We do), and Our messengers are by them, to record. Say: If (Allah) Most Gracious had a son, I would be the first to worship. Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne (of Authority)! (He is free) from the things they attribute (to him)! So leave them to babble and play (with vanities) until they meet that Day of theirs, which they have been promised. It is He Who is Allah in heaven and Allah on earth; and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge. And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all between them: with Him is the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment): and to Him shall ye be brought back. And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power of intercession;- only he who bears witness to the Truth, and they know (him). If thou ask them, who created them, they will certainly say, Allah: How then are they deluded away (from the Truth)? (Allah has knowledge) of the (Prophet´s) cry, O my Lord! Truly these are people who will not believe! But turn away from them, and say Peace! But soon shall they know! ",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"İbrahim","A. L. R. A Book which We have revealed unto thee, in order that thou mightest lead mankind out of the depths of darkness into light - by the leave of their Lord - to the Way of (Him) the Exalted in power, worthy of all praise!- Of Allah, to Whom do belong all things in the heavens and on earth! But alas for the Unbelievers for a terrible penalty (their Unfaith will bring them)!- Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, who hinder (men) from the Path of Allah and seek therein something crooked: they are astray by a long distance. We sent not a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people, in order to make (things) clear to them. Now Allah leaves straying those whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in power, full of Wisdom. We sent Moses with Our signs (and the command). Bring out thy people from the depths of darkness into light, and teach them to remember the Days of Allah. Verily in this there are Signs for such as are firmly patient and constant,- grateful and appreciative. Remember! Moses said to his people: Call to mind the favour of Allah to you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons, and let your women-folk live: therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord. And remember! your Lord caused to be declared (publicly): If ye are grateful, I will add more (favours) unto you; But if ye show ingratitude, truly My punishment is terrible indeed. And Moses said: If ye show ingratitude, ye and all on earth together, yet is Allah free of all wants, worthy of all praise. Has not the story reached you, (O people!), of those who (went) before you? - of the people of Noah, and ´Ad, and Thamud? - And of those who (came) after them? None knows them but Allah. To them came messengers with Clear (Signs); but they put their hands up to their mouths, and said: We do deny (the mission) on which ye have been sent, and we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which ye invite us. Their messengers said: Is there a doubt about Allah, The Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you, in order that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed! They said: Ah! ye are no more than human, like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from the (gods) our fathers used to worship: then bring us some clear authority. Their messengers said to them: True, we are human like yourselves, but Allah doth grant His grace to such of his servants as He pleases. It is not for us to bring you an authority except as Allah permits. And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust. No reason have we why we should not put our trust on Allah. Indeed He Has guided us to the Ways we (follow). We shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us. For those who put their trust should put their trust on Allah. And the Unbelievers said to their messengers: Be sure we shall drive you out of our land, or ye shall return to our religion. But their Lord inspired (this Message) to them: Verily We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish! And verily We shall cause you to abide in the land, and succeed them. This for such as fear the Time when they shall stand before My tribunal,- such as fear the punishment denounced. But they sought victory and decision (there and then), and frustration was the lot of every powerful obstinate transgressor. In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given, for drink, boiling fetid water. In gulps will he sip it, but never will he be near swallowing it down his throat: death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting. The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous day: No power have they over aught that they have earned: that is the straying far, far (from the goal). Seest thou not that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He so will, He can remove you and put (in your place) a new creation? Nor is that for Allah any great matter. They will all be marshalled before Allah together: then will the weak say to those who were arrogant, For us, we but followed you; can ye then avail us to all against the wrath of Allah? They will reply, If we had received the Guidance of Allah, we should have given it to you: to us it makes no difference (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience: for ourselves there is no way of escape. And Satan will say when the matter is decided: It was Allah Who gave you a promise of Truth: I too promised, but I failed in my promise to you. I had no authority over you except to call you but ye listened to me: then reproach not me, but reproach your own souls. I cannot listen to your cries, nor can ye listen to mine. I reject your former act in associating me with Allah. For wrong-doers there must be a grievous penalty. But those who believe and work righteousness will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow,- to dwell therein for aye with the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: Peace! Seest thou not how Allah sets forth a parable? - A goodly word like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the heavens,- of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord. So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive admonition. And the parable of an evil Word is that of an evil tree: It is torn up by the root from the surface of the earth: it has no stability. Allah will establish in strength those who believe, with the word that stands firm, in this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah will leave, to stray, those who do wrong: Allah doeth what He willeth. Hast thou not turned thy vision to those who have changed the favour of Allah. Into blasphemy and caused their people to descend to the House of Perdition?- Into Hell? They will burn therein,- an evil place to stay in! And they set up (idols) as equal to Allah, to mislead (men) from the Path! Say: Enjoy (your brief power)! But verily ye are making straightway for Hell! Speak to my servants who have believed, that they may establish regular prayers, and spend (in charity) out of the sustenance we have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending. It is Allah Who hath created the heavens and the earth and sendeth down rain from the skies, and with it bringeth out fruits wherewith to feed you; it is He Who hath made the ships subject to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and the rivers (also) hath He made subject to you. And He hath made subject to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the night and the day hath he (also) made subject to you. And He giveth you of all that ye ask for. But if ye count the favours of Allah, never will ye be able to number them. Verily, man is given up to injustice and ingratitude. Remember Abraham said: O my Lord! make this city one of peace and security: and preserve me and my sons from worshipping idols. O my Lord! they have indeed led astray many among mankind; He then who follows my (ways) is of me, and he that disobeys me,- but Thou art indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks. O our Lord! truly Thou dost know what we conceal and what we reveal: for nothing whatever is hidden from Allah, whether on earth or in heaven. Praise be to Allah, Who hath granted unto me in old age Isma´il and Isaac: for truly my Lord is He, the Hearer of Prayer! O my Lord! make me one who establishes regular Prayer, and also (raise such) among my offspring O our Lord! and accept Thou my Prayer. O our Lord! cover (us) with Thy Forgiveness - me, my parents, and (all) Believers, on the Day that the Reckoning will be established! Think not that Allah doth not heed the deeds of those who do wrong. He but giveth them respite against a Day when the eyes will fixedly stare in horror,- They running forward with necks outstretched, their heads uplifted, their gaze returning not towards them, and their hearts a (gaping) void! So warn mankind of the Day when the Wrath will reach them: then will the wrong-doers say: Our Lord! respite us (if only) for a short term: we will answer Thy call, and follow the messengers! What! were ye not wont to swear aforetime that ye should suffer no decline? And ye dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged their own souls; ye were clearly shown how We dealt with them; and We put forth (many) parables in your behoof! Mighty indeed were the plots which they made, but their plots were (well) within the sight of Allah, even though they were such as to shake the hills! Never think that Allah would fail his messengers in His promise: for Allah is Exalted in power, - the Lord of Retribution. One day the earth will be changed to a different earth, and so will be the heavens, and (men) will be marshalled forth, before Allah, the One, the Irresistible; And thou wilt see the sinners that day bound together in fetters;- Their garments of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with Fire; That Allah may requite each soul according to its deserts; and verily Allah is swift in calling to account. Here is a Message for mankind: Let them take warning therefrom, and let them know that He is (no other than) One Allah: let men of understanding take heed. ",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Kaf","Qaf: By the Glorious Qur´an (Thou art Allah´s Messenger). But they wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves. So the Unbelievers say: This is a wonderful thing! What! When we die and become dust, (shall we live again?) That is a (sort of) return far (from our understanding). We already know how much of them the earth takes away: With Us is a record guarding (the full account). But they deny the Truth when it comes to them: so they are in a confused state. Do they not look at the sky above them?- How We have made it and adorned it, and there are no flaws in it? And the earth- We have spread it out, and set thereon mountains standing firm, and produced therein every kind of beautiful growth (in pairs)- To be observed and commemorated by every devotee turning (to Allah). And We send down from the sky rain charted with blessing, and We produce therewith gardens and Grain for harvests; And tall (and stately) palm-trees, with shoots of fruit-stalks, piled one over another;- As sustenance for (Allah´s) Servants;- and We give (new) life therewith to land that is dead: Thus will be the Resurrection. Before them was denied (the Hereafter) by the People of Noah, the Companions of the Rass, the Thamud, The ´Ad, Pharaoh, the brethren of Lut, The Companions of the Wood, and the People of Tubba´; each one (of them) rejected the messengers, and My warning was duly fulfilled (in them). Were We then weary with the first Creation, that they should be in confused doubt about a new Creation? It was We Who created man, and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for We are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein. Behold, two (guardian angels) appointed to learn (his doings) learn (and noted them), one sitting on the right and one on the left. Not a word does he utter but there is a sentinel by him, ready (to note it). And the stupor of death will bring Truth (before his eyes): This was the thing which thou wast trying to escape! And the Trumpet shall be blown: that will be the Day whereof Warning (had been given). And there will come forth every soul: with each will be an (angel) to drive, and an (angel) to bear witness. (It will be said:) Thou wast heedless of this; now have We removed thy veil, and sharp is thy sight this Day! And his Companion will say: Here is (his Record) ready with me! (The sentence will be:) Throw, throw into Hell every contumacious Rejecter (of Allah)!- Who forbade what was good, transgressed all bounds, cast doubts and suspicions; Who set up another god beside Allah: Throw him into a severe penalty. His Companion will say: Our Lord! I did not make him transgress, but he was (himself) far astray. He will say: Dispute not with each other in My Presence: I had already in advance sent you Warning. The Word changes not before Me, and I do not the least injustice to My Servants. One Day We will ask Hell, Art thou filled to the full? It will say, Are there any more (to come)? And the Garden will be brought nigh to the Righteous,- no more a thing distant. (A voice will say:) This is what was promised for you,- for every one who turned (to Allah) in sincere repentance, who kept (His Law), Who feared (Allah) Most Gracious Unseen, and brought a heart turned in devotion (to Him): Enter ye therein in Peace and Security; this is a Day of Eternal Life! There will be for them therein all that they wish,- and more besides in Our Presence. But how many generations before them did We destroy (for their sins),- stronger in power than they? Then did they wander through the land: was there any place of escape (for them)? Verily in this is a Message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses (the truth). We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in Six Days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us. Bear, then, with patience, all that they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting. And during part of the night, (also,) celebrate His praises, and (so likewise) after the postures of adoration. And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a place quiet near,- The Day when they will hear a (mighty) Blast in (very) truth: that will be the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is We Who give Life and Death; and to Us is the Final Goal- The Day when the Earth will be rent asunder, from (men) hurrying out: that will be a gathering together,- quite easy for Us. We know best what they say; and thou art not one to overawe them by force. So admonish with the Qur´an such as fear My Warning! ",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Rad","A.L.M.R. These are the signs (or verses) of the Book: that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but most men believe not. Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne (of authority); He has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law)! Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord. And it is He who spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil o´er the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who consider! And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighbouring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand! If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed? They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)! They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments! But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is (also) strict in punishment. And the Unbelievers say: Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord? But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide. Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in (due) proportion. He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High. It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day. For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of Allah. Allah does not change a people´s lot unless they change what is in their hearts. But when (once) Allah willeth a people´s punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect. It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising) rain! Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will..yet these (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about Allah, with the strength of His power (supreme)! For Him (alone) is prayer in Truth: any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile) wandering (in the mind). Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to Allah (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings. Say: Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth? Say: (It is) Allah. Say: Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves? Say: Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light? Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: Allah is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible. He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth Allah (by parables) show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth Allah set forth parables. For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery! Is then one who doth know that that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, like one who is blind? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition;- Those who fulfil the covenant of Allah and fail not in their plighted word; Those who join together those things which Allah hath commanded to be joined, hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning; Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for such there is the final attainment of the (eternal) home,- Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the salutation): Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final home! But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home! Allah doth enlarge, or grant by (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly) rejoice in the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter. The Unbelievers say: Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord? Say: Truly Allah leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence,- Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction. For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a beautiful place of (final) return. Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most Gracious! Say: He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn! If there were a Qur´an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise. Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the unbelievers, and finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my requital! Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words? Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can guide. For them is a penalty in the life of this world, but harder, truly, is the penalty of the Hereafter: and defender have they none against Allah. The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised!- beneath it flow rivers: perpetual is the enjoyment thereof and the shade therein: such is the end of the Righteous; and the end of Unbelievers in the Fire. Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee: but there are among the clans those who reject a part thereof. Say: I am commanded to worship Allah, and not to join partners with Him. Unto Him do I call, and unto Him is my return. Thus have We revealed it to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Wert thou to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither protector nor defender against Allah. We did send messengers before thee, and appointed for them wives and children: and it was never the part of a messenger to bring a sign except as Allah permitted (or commanded). For each period is a Book (revealed). Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book. Whether We shall show thee (within thy life-time) part of what we promised them or take to ourselves thy soul (before it is all accomplished),- thy duty is to make (the Message) reach them: it is our part to call them to account. See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? (Where) Allah commands, there is none to put back His Command: and He is swift in calling to account. Those before them did (also) devise plots; but in all things the master-planning is Allah´s He knoweth the doings of every soul: and soon will the Unbelievers know who gets home in the end. The Unbelievers say: No messenger art thou. Say: Enough for a witness between me and you is Allah, and such as have knowledge of the Book. ",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Lukman","A. L. M. These are Verses of the Wise Book,- A Guide and a Mercy to the Doers of Good,- Those who establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity, and have (in their hearts) the assurance of the Hereafter. These are on (true) guidance from their Lord: and these are the ones who will prosper. But there are, among men, those who purchase idle tales, without knowledge (or meaning), to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah and throw ridicule (on the Path): for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty. When Our Signs are rehearsed to such a one, he turns away in arrogance, as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in both his ears: announce to him a grievous Penalty. For those who believe and work righteous deeds, there will be Gardens of Bliss,- To dwell therein. The promise of Allah is true: and He is Exalted in Power, Wise. He created the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; He set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and He scattered through it beasts of all kinds. We send down rain from the sky, and produce on the earth every kind of noble creature, in pairs. Such is the Creation of Allah: now show Me what is there that others besides Him have created: nay, but the Transgressors are in manifest error. we bestowed (in the past) Wisdom on Luqman: Show (thy) gratitude to Allah. Any who is (so) grateful does so to the profit of his own soul: but if any is ungrateful, verily Allah is free of all wants, Worthy of all praise. Behold, Luqman said to his son by way of instruction: O my son! join not in worship (others) with Allah: for false worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing. And We have enjoined on man (to be good) to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: (hear the command), Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is (thy final) Goal. But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not; yet bear them company in this life with justice (and consideration), and follow the way of those who turn to me (in love): in the end the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth (and meaning) of all that ye did. O my son! (said Luqman), If there be (but) the weight of a mustard-seed and it were (hidden) in a rock, or (anywhere) in the heavens or on earth, Allah will bring it forth: for Allah understands the finest mysteries, (and) is well-acquainted (with them). O my son! establish regular prayer, enjoin what is just, and forbid what is wrong: and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee; for this is firmness (of purpose) in (the conduct of) affairs. And swell not thy cheek (for pride) at men, nor walk in insolence through the earth; for Allah loveth not any arrogant boaster. And be moderate in thy pace, and lower thy voice; for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass. Do ye not see that Allah has subjected to your (use) all things in the heavens and on earth, and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure, (both) seen and unseen? Yet there are among men those who dispute about Allah, without knowledge and without guidance, and without a Book to enlighten them! When they are told to follow the (Revelation) that Allah has sent down, they say: Nay, we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers (following). What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the (Blazing) Fire? Whoever submits his whole self to Allah, and is a doer of good, has grasped indeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with Allah rests the End and Decision of (all) affairs. But if any reject Faith, let not his rejection grieve thee: to Us is their return, and We shall tell them the truth of their deeds: for Allah knows well all that is in (men´s) hearts. We grant them their pleasure for a little while: in the end shall We drive them to a chastisement unrelenting. If thou ask them, who it is that created the heavens and the earth. They will certainly say, Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them understand not. To Allah belong all things in heaven and earth: verily Allah is He (that is) free of all wants, worthy of all praise. And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean (were ink), with seven oceans behind it to add to its (supply), yet would not the words of Allah be exhausted (in the writing): for Allah is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individual soul: for Allah is He Who hears and sees (all things). Seest thou not that Allah merges Night into Day and he merges Day into Night; that He has subjected the sun, and the moon (to his Law), each running its course for a term appointed; and that Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do? That is because Allah is the (only) Reality, and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because Allah,- He is the Most High, Most Great. Seest thou not that the ships sail through the ocean by the Grace of Allah?- that He may show you of His Signs? Verily in this are Signs for all who constantly persevere and give thanks. When a wave covers them like the canopy (of clouds), they call to Allah, offering Him sincere devotion. But when He has delivered them safely to land, there are among them those that halt between (right and wrong). But none reject Our Signs except only a perfidious ungrateful (wretch)! O mankind! do your duty to your Lord, and fear (the coming of) a Day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father. Verily, the promise of Allah is true: let not then this present life deceive you, nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah. Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). It is He Who sends down rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does any one know what it is that he will earn on the morrow: Nor does any one know in what land he is to die. Verily with Allah is full knowledge and He is acquainted (with all things). ",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Neml","These are verses of the Qur´an,-a book that makes (things) clear; A guide: and glad tidings for the believers,- Those who establish regular prayers and give in regular charity, and also have (full) assurance of the hereafter. As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds pleasing in their eyes; and so they wander about in distraction. Such are they for whom a grievous Penalty is (waiting); and in the Hereafter theirs will be the greatest loss. As to thee, the Qur´an is bestowed upon thee from the presence of one who is wise and all-knowing. Behold! Moses said to his family: I perceive a fire; soon will I bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand to light our fuel, that ye may warm yourselves. But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard: Blessed are those in the fire and those around: and glory to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. O Moses! verily, I am Allah, the exalted in might, the wise!.... Now do thou throw thy rod! But when he saw it moving (of its own accord)as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: O Moses! (it was said), Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called as messengers have no fear,- But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil, truly, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Now put thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm): (these are) among the nine Signs (thou wilt take) to Pharaoh and his people: for they are a people rebellious in transgression. But when Our Signs came to them, that should have opened their eyes, they said: This is sorcery manifest! And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly! We gave (in the past) knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said: Praise be to Allah, Who has favoured us above many of his servants who believe! And Solomon was David´s heir. He said: O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and on us has been bestowed (a little) of all things: this is indeed Grace manifest (from Allah.) And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of Jinns and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks. At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it. So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants. And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees? I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence). But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true. I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne. I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah: Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from the Path,- so they receive no guidance,- (Kept them away from the Path), that they should not worship Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal. Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme! (Solomon) said: Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied! Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return... (The queen) said: Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect. It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): ´In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful: ´Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).´ She said: Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence. They said: We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command. She said: Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave. But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors. Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift! Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and they will feel humbled (indeed). He said (to his own men): Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission? Said an ´Ifrit, of the Jinns: I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted. Said one who had knowledge of the Book: I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye! Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour ! He said: Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no guidance. So when she arrived, she was asked, Is this thy throne? She said, It was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have submitted to Allah (in Islam). And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith. She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her legs. He said: This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass. She said: O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam), with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds. We sent (aforetime), to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, Serve Allah: But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other. He said: O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy. They said: Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee. He said: Your ill omen is with Allah; yea, ye are a people under trial. There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform. They said: Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): ´We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and we are positively telling the truth.´ They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived it not. Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them). Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practised wrong-doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge. And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness. (We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold, He said to his people, Do ye do what is shameful though ye see (its iniquity)? Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people (grossly) ignorant! But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, Drive out the followers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure! But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lagged behind. And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! Say: Praise be to Allah, and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen (for his Message). (Who) is better?- Allah or the false gods they associate (with Him)? Or, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who sends you down rain from the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beauty of delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them. (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay, they are a people who swerve from justice. Or, Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; set thereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two bodies of flowing water? (can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay, most of them know not. Or, Who listens to the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him, and Who relieves its suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed! Or, Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy? (Can there be another) god besides Allah?- High is Allah above what they associate with Him! Or, Who originates creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Say, Bring forth your argument, if ye are telling the truth! Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except Allah, knows what is hidden: nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment). Still less can their knowledge comprehend the Hereafter: Nay, they are in doubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay, they are blind thereunto! The Unbelievers say: What! when we become dust,- we and our fathers,- shall we really be raised (from the dead)? It is true we were promised this,- we and our fathers before (us): these are nothing but tales of the ancients. Say: Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty (of sin). But grieve not over them, nor distress thyself because of their plots. They also say: When will this promise (come to pass)? (Say) if ye are truthful. Say: It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be (close) in your pursuit! But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful. And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide. As well as all that they reveal. Nor is there aught of the unseen, in heaven or earth, but is (recorded) in a clear record. Verily this Qur´an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters in which they disagree. And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe. Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted in Might, All-Knowing. So put thy trust in Allah: for thou art on (the path of) manifest Truth. Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst thou cause the deaf to hear the call, (especially) when they turn back in retreat. Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind, (to prevent them) from straying: only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs, and they will bow in Islam. And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), we shall produce from the earth a beast to (face) them: He will speak to them, for that mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs. One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who reject our Signs, and they shall be kept in ranks,- Until, when they come (before the Judgment-seat), (Allah) will say: Did ye reject My Signs, though ye comprehended them not in knowledge, or what was it ye did? And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrong-doing, and they will be unable to speak (in plea). See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe! And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with terror those who are in the heavens, and those who are on earth, except such as Allah will please (to exempt): and all shall come to His (Presence) as beings conscious of their lowliness. Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of Allah, who disposes of all things in perfect order: for he is well acquainted with all that ye do. If any do good, good will (accrue) to them therefrom; and they will be secure from terror that Day. And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: Do ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds? For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city, Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam to Allah´s Will,- And to rehearse the Qur´an: and if any accept guidance, they do it for the good of their own souls, and if any stray, say: I am only a Warner. And say: Praise be to Allah, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that ye shall know them; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Secde","A. L. M. (This is) the Revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,- from the Lord of the Worlds. Or do they say, He has forged it? Nay, it is the Truth from thy Lord, that thou mayest admonish a people to whom no warner has come before thee: in order that they may receive guidance. It is Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all between them, in six Days, and is firmly established on the Throne (of Authority): ye have none, besides Him, to protect or intercede (for you): will ye not then receive admonition? He rules (all) affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will (all affairs) go up to Him, on a Day, the space whereof will be (as) a thousand years of your reckoning. Such is He, the Knower of all things, hidden and open, the Exalted (in power), the Merciful;- He Who has made everything which He has created most good: He began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay, And made his progeny from a quintessence of the nature of a fluid despised: But He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him something of His spirit. And He gave you (the faculties of) hearing and sight and feeling (and understanding): little thanks do ye give! And they say: What! when we lie, hidden and lost, in the earth, shall we indeed be in a Creation renewed? Nay, they deny the Meeting with their Lord. Say: The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls: then shall ye be brought back to your Lord. If only thou couldst see when the guilty ones will bend low their heads before their Lord, (saying:) Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard: Now then send us back (to the world): we will work righteousness: for we do indeed (now) believe. If We had so willed, We could certainly have brought every soul its true guidance: but the Word from Me will come true, I will fill Hell with Jinns and men all together. Taste ye then - for ye forgot the Meeting of this Day of yours, and We too will forget you - taste ye the Penalty of Eternity for your (evil) deeds! Only those believe in Our Signs, who, when they are recited to them, fall down in prostration, and celebrate the praises of their Lord, nor are they (ever) puffed up with pride. Their limbs do forsake their beds of sleep, the while they call on their Lord, in Fear and Hope: and they spend (in charity) out of the sustenance which We have bestowed on them. Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden (in reserve) for them - as a reward for their (good) deeds. Is then the man who believes no better than the man who is rebellious and wicked? Not equal are they. For those who believe and do righteous deeds are Gardens as hospitable homes, for their (good) deeds. As to those who are rebellious and wicked, their abode will be the Fire: every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be forced thereinto, and it will be said to them: Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire, the which ye were wont to reject as false. And indeed We will make them taste of the Penalty of this (life) prior to the supreme Penalty, in order that they may (repent and) return. And who does more wrong than one to whom are recited the Signs of his Lord, and who then turns away therefrom? Verily from those who transgress We shall exact (due) Retribution. We did indeed aforetime give the Book to Moses: be not then in doubt of its reaching (thee): and We made it a guide to the Children of Israel. And We appointed, from among them, leaders, giving guidance under Our command, so long as they persevered with patience and continued to have faith in Our Signs. Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, in the matters wherein they differ (among themselves) Does it not teach them a lesson, how many generations We destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they (now) go to and fro? Verily in that are Signs: Do they not then listen? And do they not see that We do drive rain to parched soil (bare of herbage), and produce therewith crops, providing food for their cattle and themselves? Have they not the vision? They say: When will this decision be, if ye are telling the truth? Say: On the Day of Decision, no profit will it be to Unbelievers if they (then) believe! nor will they be granted a respite. So turn away from them, and wait: they too are waiting. ",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hicr","A. L. R. These are the Ayats of Revelation,- of a Qur´an that makes things clear. Again and again will those who disbelieve, wish that they had bowed (to Allah´s will) in Islam. Leave them alone, to enjoy (the good things of this life) and to please themselves: let (false) hope amuse them: soon will knowledge (undeceive them). Never did We destroy a population that had not a term decreed and assigned beforehand. Neither can a people anticipate its term, nor delay it. They say: O thou to whom the Message is being revealed! truly thou art mad (or possessed)! Why bringest thou not angels to us if it be that thou hast the Truth? We send not the angels down except for just cause: if they came (to the ungodly), behold! no respite would they have! We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption). We did send messengers before thee amongst the religious sects of old: But never came a messenger to them but they mocked him. Even so do we let it creep into the hearts of the sinners - That they should not believe in the (Message); but the ways of the ancients have passed away. Even if We opened out to them a gate from heaven, and they were to continue (all day) ascending therein, They would only say: Our eyes have been intoxicated: Nay, we have been bewitched by sorcery. It is We Who have set out the zodiacal signs in the heavens, and made them fair-seeming to (all) beholders; And (moreover) We have guarded them from every cursed devil: But any that gains a hearing by stealth, is pursued by a flaming fire, bright (to see). And the earth We have spread out (like a carpet); set thereon mountains firm and immovable; and produced therein all kinds of things in due balance. And We have provided therein means of subsistence,- for you and for those for whose sustenance ye are not responsible. And there is not a thing but its (sources and) treasures (inexhaustible) are with Us; but We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable measures. And We send the fecundating winds, then cause the rain to descend from the sky, therewith providing you with water (in abundance), though ye are not the guardians of its stores. And verily, it is We Who give life, and Who give death: it is We Who remain inheritors (after all else passes away). To Us are known those of you who hasten forward, and those who lag behind. Assuredly it is thy Lord Who will gather them together: for He is perfect in Wisdom and Knowledge. We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape; And the Jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind. Behold! thy Lord said to the angels: I am about to create man, from sounding clay from mud moulded into shape; When I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him. So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together: Not so Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves. (Allah) said: O Iblis! what is your reason for not being among those who prostrated themselves? (Iblis) said: I am not one to prostrate myself to man, whom Thou didst create from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape. (Allah) said: Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed. And the curse shall be on thee till the day of Judgment. (Iblis) said: O my Lord! give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised. (Allah) said: Respite is granted thee Till the Day of the Time appointed. (Iblis) said: O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make (wrong) fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong,- Except Thy servants among them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace). (Allah) said: This (way of My sincere servants) is indeed a way that leads straight to Me. For over My servants no authority shalt thou have, except such as put themselves in the wrong and follow thee. And verily, Hell is the promised abode for them all! To it are seven gates: for each of those gates is a (special) class (of sinners) assigned. The righteous (will be) amid gardens and fountains (of clear-flowing water). (Their greeting will be): Enter ye here in peace and security. And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury: (they will be) brothers (joyfully) facing each other on thrones (of dignity). There no sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave. Tell My servants that I am indeed the Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful; And that My Penalty will be indeed the most grievous Penalty. Tell them about the guests of Abraham. When they entered his presence and said, Peace! He said, We feel afraid of you! They said: Fear not! We give thee glad tidings of a son endowed with wisdom. He said: Do ye give me glad tidings that old age has seized me? Of what, then, is your good news? They said: We give thee glad tidings in truth: be not then in despair! He said: And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but such as go astray? Abraham said: What then is the business on which ye (have come), O ye messengers (of Allah)? They said: We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin, Excepting the adherents of Lut: them we are certainly (charged) to save (from harm),- All - Except his wife, who, We have ascertained, will be among those who will lag behind. At length when the messengers arrived among the adherents of Lut, He said: Ye appear to be uncommon folk. They said: Yea, we have come to thee to accomplish that of which they doubt. We have brought to thee that which is inevitably due, and assuredly we tell the truth. Then travel by night with thy household, when a portion of the night (yet remains), and do thou bring up the rear: let no one amongst you look back, but pass on whither ye are ordered. And We made known this decree to him, that the last remnants of those (sinners) should be cut off by the morning. The inhabitants of the city came in (mad) joy (at news of the young men). Lut said: These are my guests: disgrace me not: But fear Allah, and shame me not. They said: Did we not forbid thee (to speak) for all and sundry? He said: There are my daughters (to marry), if ye must act (so). Verily, by thy life (O Prophet), in their wild intoxication, they wander in distraction, to and fro. But the (mighty) Blast overtook them before morning, And We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay. Behold! in this are Signs for those who by tokens do understand. And the (cities were) right on the high-road. Behold! in this is a sign for those who believed. And the Companions of the Wood were also wrong-doers; So We exacted retribution from them. They were both on an open highway, plain to see. The Companions of the Rocky Tract also rejected the messengers: We sent them Our Signs, but they persisted in turning away from them. Out of the mountains did they hew (their) edifices, (feeling themselves) secure. But the (mighty) Blast seized them of a morning, And of no avail to them was all that they did (with such art and care)! We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for just ends. And the Hour is surely coming (when this will be manifest). So overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness. For verily it is thy Lord who is the Master-Creator, knowing all things. And We have bestowed upon thee the Seven Oft-repeated (verses) and the Grand Qur´an. Strain not thine eyes. (Wistfully) at what We have bestowed on certain classes of them, nor grieve over them: but lower thy wing (in gentleness) to the believers. And say: I am indeed he that warneth openly and without ambiguity,- (Of just such wrath) as We sent down on those who divided (Scripture into arbitrary parts),- (So also on such) as have made Qur´an into shreds (as they please). Therefore, by the Lord, We will, of a surety, call them to account, For all their deeds. Therefore expound openly what thou art commanded, and turn away from those who join false gods with Allah. For sufficient are We unto thee against those who scoff,- Those who adopt, with Allah, another god: but soon will they come to know. We do indeed know how thy heart is distressed at what they say. But celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostrate themselves in adoration. And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain. ",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sad","Sad: By the Qur´an, Full of Admonition: (This is the Truth). But the Unbelievers (are steeped) in self-glory and Separatism. How many generations before them did We destroy? In the end they cried (for mercy)- when there was no longer time for being saved! So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and the Unbelievers say, This is a sorcerer telling lies! Has he made the gods (all) into one Allah? Truly this is a wonderful thing! And the leader among them go away (impatiently), (saying), Walk ye away, and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed (against you)! We never heard (the like) of this among the people of these latter days: this is nothing but a made-up tale! What! has the Message been sent to him - (Of all persons) among us?...but they are in doubt concerning My (Own) Message! Nay, they have not yet tasted My Punishment! Or have they the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord,- the Exalted in Power, the Grantor of Bounties without measure? Or have they the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between? If so, let them mount up with the ropes and means (to reach that end)! But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates. Before them (were many who) rejected messengers,- the people of Noah, and ´Ad, and Pharaoh, the Lord of Stakes, And Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the Companions of the Wood; - such were the Confederates. Not one (of them) but rejected the messengers, but My punishment came justly and inevitably (on them). These (today) only wait for a single mighty Blast, which (when it comes) will brook no delay. They say: Our Lord! hasten to us our sentence (even) before the Day of Account! Have patience at what they say, and remember our servant David, the man of strength: for he ever turned (to Allah). It was We that made the hills declare, in unison with him, Our Praises, at eventide and at break of day, And the birds gathered (in assemblies): all with him did turn (to Allah). We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision. Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee? Behold, they climbed over the wall of the private chamber; When they entered the presence of David, and he was terrified of them, they said: Fear not: we are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other: Decide now between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, but guide us to the even Path.. This man is my brother: He has nine and ninety ewes, and I have (but) one: Yet he says, ´commit her to my care,´ and is (moreover) harsh to me in speech. (David) said: He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy (single) ewe to be added to his (flock of) ewes: truly many are the partners (in business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and how few are they?...and David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord, fell down, bowing (in prostration), and turned (to Allah in repentance). So We forgave him this (lapse): he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful place of (Final) Return. O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth: so judge thou between men in truth (and justice): Nor follow thou the lusts (of thy heart), for they will mislead thee from the Path of Allah: for those who wander astray from the Path of Allah, is a Penalty Grievous, for that they forget the Day of Account. Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! that were the thought of Unbelievers! but woe to the Unbelievers because of the Fire (of Hell)! Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right? (Here is) a Book which We have sent down unto thee, full of blessings, that they may mediate on its Signs, and that men of understanding may receive admonition. To David We gave Solomon (for a son),- How excellent in Our service! Ever did he turn (to Us)! Behold, there were brought before him, at eventide coursers of the highest breeding, and swift of foot; And he said, Truly do I love the love of good, with a view to the glory of my Lord,- until (the sun) was hidden in the veil (of night): Bring them back to me. then began he to pass his hand over (their) legs and their necks. And We did try Solomon: We placed on his throne a body (without life); but he did turn (to Us in true devotion): He said, O my Lord! Forgive me, and grant me a kingdom which, (it may be), suits not another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without measure). Then We subjected the wind to his power, to flow gently to his order, Whithersoever he willed,- As also the evil ones, (including) every kind of builder and diver,- As also others bound together in fetters. Such are Our Bounties: whether thou bestow them (on others) or withhold them, no account will be asked. And he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful Place of (Final) Return. Commemorate Our Servant Job. Behold he cried to his Lord: The Evil One has afflicted me with distress and suffering! (The command was given:) Strike with thy foot: here is (water) wherein to wash, cool and refreshing, and (water) to drink. And We gave him (back) his people, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Ourselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who have Understanding. And take in thy hand a little grass, and strike therewith: and break not (thy oath). Truly We found him full of patience and constancy. How excellent in Our service! ever did he turn (to Us)! And commemorate Our Servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, possessors of Power and Vision. Verily We did choose them for a special (purpose)- proclaiming the Message of the Hereafter. They were, in Our sight, truly, of the company of the Elect and the Good. And commemorate Isma´il, Elisha, and Zul-Kifl: Each of them was of the Company of the Good. This is a Message (of admonition): and verily, for the righteous, is a beautiful Place of (Final) Return,- Gardens of Eternity, whose doors will (ever) be open to them; Therein will they recline (at ease): Therein can they call (at pleasure) for fruit in abundance, and (delicious) drink; And beside them will be chaste women restraining their glances, (companions) of equal age. Such is the Promise made, to you for the Day of Account! Truly such will be Our Bounty (to you); it will never fail;- Yea, such! but - for the wrong-doers will be an evil place of (Final) Return!- Hell!- they will burn therein, - an evil bed (indeed, to lie on)!- Yea, such! - then shall they taste it,- a boiling fluid, and a fluid dark, murky, intensely cold!- And other Penalties of a similar kind, to match them! Here is a troop rushing headlong with you! No welcome for them! truly, they shall burn in the Fire! (The followers shall cry to the misleaders:) Nay, ye (too)! No welcome for you! It is ye who have brought this upon us! Now evil is (this) place to stay in! They will say: Our Lord! whoever brought this upon us,- Add to him a double Penalty in the Fire! And they will say: What has happened to us that we see not men whom we used to number among the bad ones? Did we treat them (as such) in ridicule, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them? Truly that is just and fitting,- the mutual recriminations of the People of the Fire! Say: Truly am I a Warner: no god is there but the one Allah, Supreme and Irresistible,- The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- Exalted in Might, able to enforce His Will, forgiving again and again. Say: That is a Message Supreme (above all),- From which ye do turn away! No knowledge have I of the Chiefs on high, when they discuss (matters) among themselves. ´Only this has been revealed to me: that I am to give warning plainly and publicly. Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: I am about to create man from clay: When I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him. So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together: Not so Iblis: he was haughty, and became one of those who reject Faith. (Allah) said: O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of the high (and mighty) ones? (Iblis) said: I am better than he: thou createdst me from fire, and him thou createdst from clay. (Allah) said: Then get thee out from here: for thou art rejected, accursed. And My curse shall be on thee till the Day of Judgment. (Iblis) said: O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are raised. (Allah) said: Respite then is granted thee- Till the Day of the Time Appointed. (Iblis) said: Then, by Thy power, I will put them all in the wrong,- Except Thy Servants amongst them, sincere and purified (by Thy Grace). (Allah) said: Then it is just and fitting- and I say what is just and fitting- That I will certainly fill Hell with thee and those that follow thee,- every one. Say: No reward do I ask of you for this (Qur´an), nor am I a pretender. This is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds. And ye shall certainly know the truth of it (all) after a while.

"Kalem","Nun. By the Pen and the (Record) which (men) write,- Thou art not, by the Grace of thy Lord, mad or possessed. Nay, verily for thee is a Reward unfailing: And thou (standest) on an exalted standard of character. Soon wilt thou see, and they will see, Which of you is afflicted with madness. Verily it is thy Lord that knoweth best, which (among men) hath strayed from His Path: and He knoweth best those who receive (true) Guidance. So hearken not to those who deny (the Truth). Their desire is that thou shouldst be pliant: so would they be pliant. Heed not the type of despicable men,- ready with oaths, A slanderer, going about with calumnies, (Habitually) hindering (all) good, transgressing beyond bounds, deep in sin, Violent (and cruel),- with all that, base-born,- Because he possesses wealth and (numerous) sons. When to him are rehearsed Our Signs, Tales of the ancients, he cries! Soon shall We brand (the beast) on the snout! Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden, when they resolved to gather the fruits of the (garden) in the morning. But made no reservation, (If it be Allah´s Will). Then there came on the (garden) a visitation from thy Lord, (which swept away) all around, while they were asleep. So the (garden) became, by the morning, like a dark and desolate spot, (whose fruit had been gathered). As the morning broke, they called out, one to another,- Go ye to your tilth (betimes) in the morning, if ye would gather the fruits. So they departed, conversing in secret low tones, (saying)- Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the (garden) this day. And they opened the morning, strong in an (unjust) resolve. But when they saw the (garden), they said: We have surely lost our way: Indeed we are shut out (of the fruits of our labour)! Said one of them, more just (than the rest): Did I not say to you, ´Why not glorify (Allah)?´ They said: Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong! Then they turned, one against another, in reproach. They said: Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed! It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this: for we do turn to Him (in repentance)! Such is the Punishment (in this life); but greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter,- if only they knew! Verily, for the Righteous, are Gardens of Delight, in the Presence of their Lord. Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin? What is the matter with you? How judge ye? Or have ye a book through which ye learn- That ye shall have, through it whatever ye choose? Or have ye Covenants with Us to oath, reaching to the Day of Judgment, (providing) that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand? Ask thou of them, which of them will stand surety for that! Or have they some Partners (in Allahhead)? Then let them produce their partners, if they are truthful! The Day that the shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able,- Their eyes will be cast down,- ignominy will cover them; seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration, while they were whole, (and had refused). Then leave Me alone with such as reject this Message: by degrees shall We punish them from directions they perceive not. A (long) respite will I grant them: truly powerful is My Plan. Or is it that thou dost ask them for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of debt?- Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down? So wait with patience for the Command of thy Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish,- when he cried out in agony. Had not Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been cast off on the naked shore, in disgrace. Thus did his Lord choose him and make him of the Company of the Righteous. And the Unbelievers would almost trip thee up with their eyes when they hear the Message; and they say: Surely he is possessed! But it is nothing less than a Message to all the worlds.

"Ali İmran","A. L. M. Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong). Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution. From Allah, verily nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens. He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord: and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding. Our Lord! (they say), Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hast guided us, but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence; for Thou art the Grantor of bounties without measure. Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt; for Allah never fails in His promise. Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They are themselves but fuel for the Fire. (Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh, and their predecessors: They denied our Signs, and Allah called them to account for their sins. For Allah is strict in punishment. Say to those who reject Faith: Soon will ye be vanquished and gathered together to Hell,-an evil bed indeed (to lie on)! There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat): One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number. But Allah doth support with His aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see. Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: Women and sons; Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver; horses branded (for blood and excellence); and (wealth of) cattle and well-tilled land. Such are the possessions of this world´s life; but in nearness to Allah is the best of the goals (To return to). Say: Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those? For the righteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath; therein is their eternal home; with companions pure (and holy); and the good pleasure of Allah. For in Allah´s sight are (all) His servants,- (Namely), those who say: Our Lord! we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins, and save us from the agony of the Fire;- Those who show patience, Firmness and self-control; who are true (in word and deed); who worship devoutly; who spend (in the way of Allah); and who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning. There is no god but He: That is the witness of Allah, His angels, and those endued with knowledge, standing firm on justice. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Power, the Wise. The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account. So if they dispute with thee, say: I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me. And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: Do ye (also) submit yourselves? If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah´s sight are (all) His servants. As to those who deny the Signs of Allah and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty. They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter nor will they have anyone to help. Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who have been given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah, to settle their dispute, but a party of them Turn back and decline (The arbitration). This because they say: The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days: For their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion. But how (will they fare) when we gather them together against a day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned, without (favour or) injustice? Say: O Allah! Lord of Power (And Rule), Thou givest power to whom Thou pleasest, and Thou strippest off power from whom Thou pleasest: Thou enduest with honour whom Thou pleasest, and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest: In Thy hand is all good. Verily, over all things Thou hast power. Thou causest the night to gain on the day, and thou causest the day to gain on the night; Thou bringest the Living out of the dead, and Thou bringest the dead out of the Living; and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest, without measure. Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah: except by way of precaution, that ye may Guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you (To remember) Himself; for the final goal is to Allah. Say: Whether ye hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it all: He knows what is in the heavens, and what is on earth. And Allah has power over all things. On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good it has done, and all the evil it has done, it will wish there were a great distance between it and its evil. But Allah cautions you (To remember) Himself. And Allah is full of kindness to those that serve Him. Say: If ye do love Allah, Follow me: Allah will love you and forgive you your sins: For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: Obey Allah and His Messenger: But if they turn back, Allah loveth not those who reject Faith. Allah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of ´Imran above all people,- Offspring, one of the other: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. Behold! a woman of ´Imran said: O my Lord! I do dedicate unto Thee what is in my womb for Thy special service: So accept this of me: For Thou hearest and knowest all things. When she was delivered, she said: O my Lord! Behold! I am delivered of a female child!- and Allah knew best what she brought forth- And no wise is the male Like the female. I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspring to Thy protection from the Evil One, the Rejected. Right graciously did her Lord accept her: He made her grow in purity and beauty: To the care of Zakariya was she assigned. Every time that he entered (Her) chamber to see her, He found her supplied with sustenance. He said: O Mary! Whence (comes) this to you? She said: From Allah: for Allah Provides sustenance to whom He pleases without measure. There did Zakariya pray to his Lord, saying: O my Lord! Grant unto me from Thee a progeny that is pure: for Thou art He that heareth prayer! While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called unto him: Allah doth give thee glad tidings of Yahya, witnessing the truth of a Word from Allah, and (be besides) noble, chaste, and a prophet,- of the (goodly) company of the righteous. He said: O my Lord! How shall I have son, seeing I am very old, and my wife is barren? Thus, was the answer, Doth Allah accomplish what He willeth. He said: O my Lord! Give me a Sign! Thy Sign, was the answer, Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three days but with signals. Then celebrate the praises of thy Lord again and again, and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning. Behold! the angels said: O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee- chosen thee above the women of all nations. O Mary! worship Thy Lord devoutly: Prostrate thyself, and bow down (in prayer) with those who bow down. This is part of the tidings of the things unseen, which We reveal unto thee (O Messenger!) by inspiration: Thou wast not with them when they cast lots with arrows, as to which of them should be charged with the care of Mary: Nor wast thou with them when they disputed (the point). Behold! the angels said: O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honour in this world and the Hereafter and of (the company of) those nearest to Allah; He shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. And he shall be (of the company) of the righteous. She said: O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man hath touched me? He said: Even so: Allah createth what He willeth: When He hath decreed a plan, He but saith to it, ´Be,´ and it is! And Allah will teach him the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel, And (appoint him) a messenger to the Children of Israel, (with this message): ´I have come to you, with a Sign from your Lord, in that I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah´s leave: And I heal those born blind, and the lepers, and I quicken the dead, by Allah´s leave; and I declare to you what ye eat, and what ye store in your houses. Surely therein is a Sign for you if ye did believe; ´(I have come to you), to attest the Law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was (Before) forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me. ´It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Way that is straight.´ When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah? Said the disciples: We are Allah´s helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims. Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us down among those who bear witness. And (the unbelievers) plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and the best of planners is Allah. Behold! Allah said: O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute. As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help. As to those who believe and work righteousness, Allah will pay them (in full) their reward; but Allah loveth not those who do wrong. This is what we rehearse unto thee of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom. The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: Be. And he was. The Truth (comes) from Allah alone; so be not of those who doubt. If any one disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge Hath come to thee, say: Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie! This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah. If then they turn back, say ye: Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to Allah´s Will). Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing (Even) in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to Allah´s (Which is Islam), and he joined not gods with Allah. Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those who follow him, as are also this Prophet and those who believe: And Allah is the Protector of those who have faith. It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray. But they shall lead astray (Not you), but themselves, and they do not perceive! Ye People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, of which ye are (Yourselves) witnesses? Ye People of the Book! Why do ye clothe Truth with falsehood, and conceal the Truth, while ye have knowledge? A section of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning what is revealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may (themselves) Turn back; And believe no one unless he follows your religion. Say: True guidance is the Guidance of Allah: (Fear ye) Lest a revelation be sent to someone (else) Like unto that which was sent unto you? or that those (Receiving such revelation) should engage you in argument before your Lord? Say: All bounties are in the hand of Allah: He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things. For His Mercy He specially chooseth whom He pleaseth; for Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded. Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will (readily) pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding, because, they say, there is no call on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (Pagans). but they tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it. Nay.- Those that keep their plighted faith and act aright,-verily Allah loves those who act aright. As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plighted word for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor will Allah (Deign to) speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He cleans them (of sin): They shall have a grievous penalty. There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: (As they read) you would think it is a part of the Book, but it is no part of the Book; and they say, That is from Allah, but it is not from Allah: It is they who tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it! It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the prophetic office, should say to people: Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah´s: on the contrary (He would say) Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly. Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (To Allah in Islam)? Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger, confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help. Allah said: Do ye agree, and take this my Covenant as binding on you? They said: We agree. He said: Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses. If any turn back after this, they are perverted transgressors. Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah?-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back. Say: We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma´il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islam). If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good). How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them? but Allah guides not a people unjust. Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of His angels, and of all mankind;- In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened, nor respite be (their lot);- Except for those that repent (Even) after that, and make amends; for verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray. As to those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous, and they will find no helpers. By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give (freely) of that which ye love; and whatever ye give, of a truth Allah knoweth it well. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel Made unlawful for itself, before the Law (of Moses) was revealed. Say: Bring ye the Law and study it, if ye be men of truth. If any, after this, invent a lie and attribute it to Allah, they are indeed unjust wrong-doers. Say: Allah speaketh the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham, the sane in faith; he was not of the Pagans. The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka: Full of blessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings: In it are Signs Manifest; (for example), the Station of Abraham; whoever enters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah,- those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith, Allah stands not in need of any of His creatures. Say: O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, when Allah is Himself witness to all ye do? Say: O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe, from the path of Allah, Seeking to make it crooked, while ye were yourselves witnesses (to Allah´s Covenant)? but Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do. O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book, they would (indeed) render you apostates after ye have believed! And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs of Allah, and among you Lives the Messenger? Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be shown a way that is straight. O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam. And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah´s favour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye may be guided. Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity. Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty,- On the Day when some faces will be (lit up with) white, and some faces will be (in the gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black, (will be said): Did ye reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the penalty for rejecting Faith. But those whose faces will be (lit with) white,- they will be in (the light of) Allah´s mercy: therein to dwell (for ever). These are the Signs of Allah: We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And Allah means no injustice to any of His creatures. To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do all questions go back (for decision). Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors. They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get. Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds. Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous. Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that do right. Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They will be companions of the Fire,-dwelling therein (for ever). What they spend in the life of this (material) world May be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them, but they wrong themselves. O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom. Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not,- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, We believe: But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: Perish in you rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart. If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are constant and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do. Remember that morning Thou didst leave Thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things: Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but Allah was their protector, and in Allah should the faithful (Ever) put their trust. Allah had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear Allah; thus May ye show your gratitude. Remember thou saidst to the Faithful: Is it not enough for you that Allah should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent down? Yea, - if ye remain firm, and act aright, even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angels Making a terrific onslaught. Allah made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted, the Wise: That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy, and they should then be turned back, frustrated of their purpose. Not for thee, (but for Allah), is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy to them, or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers. To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah; that ye may (really) prosper. Fear the Fire, which is repaired for those who reject Faith: And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy. Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose width is that (of the whole) of the heavens and of the earth, prepared for the righteous,- Those who spend (freely), whether in prosperity, or in adversity; who restrain anger, and pardon (all) men;- for Allah loves those who do good;- And those who, having done something to be ashamed of, or wronged their own souls, earnestly bring Allah to mind, and ask for forgiveness for their sins,- and who can forgive sins except Allah?- and are never obstinate in persisting knowingly in (the wrong) they have done. For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath,- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for those who work (and strive)! Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth. Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those who fear Allah! So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith. If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that Allah may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to Truth). And Allah loveth not those that do wrong. Allah´s object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to deprive of blessing Those that resist Faith. Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of you who fought hard (In His Cause) and remained steadfast? Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen him with your own eyes, (And ye flinch!) Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve Him) with gratitude. Nor can a soul die except by Allah´s leave, the term being fixed as by writing. If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and if any do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftly shall We reward those that (serve us with) gratitude. How many of the prophets fought (in Allah´s way), and with them (fought) Large bands of godly men? but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in Allah´s way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah Loves those who are firm and steadfast. All that they said was: Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything We may have done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly, and help us against those that resist Faith. And Allah gave them a reward in this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah Loveth those who do good. O ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers, they will drive you back on your heels, and ye will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss. Nay, Allah is your protector, and He is the best of helpers. Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers! Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe. Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a side glance at any one, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital, to teach you not to grieve for (the booty) that had escaped you and for (the ill) that had befallen you. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do. After (the excitement) of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance. They said: What affair is this of ours? Say thou: Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah´s. They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here. Say: Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts. Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met,-it was Satan who caused them to fail, because of some (evil) they had done. But Allah Has blotted out (their fault): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain. This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do. And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all they could amass. And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together. It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (Their faults), and ask for (Allah´s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast Taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him). If Allah helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? in Allah, then, Let believers put their trust. No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false, He shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due,- whatever it earned,- and none shall be dealt with unjustly. Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah Like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and whose abode is in Hell?- A woeful refuge! They are in varying gardens in the sight of Allah, and Allah sees well all that they do. Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah, sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, before that, they had been in manifest error. What! When a single disaster smites you, although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, do ye say?- Whence is this? Say (to them): It is from yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things. What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met, was with the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers,- And the Hypocrites also. These were told: Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city). They said: Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you. They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal. (They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain. Say: Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth. Think not of those who are slain in Allah´s way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah: And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve. They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah, and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least). Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward;- Men said to them: A great army is gathering against you: And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: For us Allah sufficeth, and He is the best disposer of affairs. And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah: And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded. It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have Faith. Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah: Allah´s plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment. Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith,- not the least harm will they do to Allah, but they will have a grievous punishment. Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment. Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (For the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah. And His messengers: And if ye believe and do right, ye have a reward without measure. And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do. Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: Truly, Allah is indigent and we are rich!- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire! This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never harms those who serve Him. They (also) said: Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven). Say: There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth? Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs. And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made! Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think escape the penalty. For them is a penalty Grievous indeed. To Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allah hath power over all things. Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day,- there are indeed Signs for men of understanding,- Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth, (With the thought): Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire. Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, Truly Thou coverest with shame, and never will wrong-doers Find any helpers! Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling (Us) to Faith, ´Believe ye in the Lord,´ and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of the righteous. Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thine messengers, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou never breakest Thy promise. And their Lord hath accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: Ye are members, one of another: Those who have left their homes, or been driven out therefrom, or suffered harm in My Cause, or fought or been slain,- verily, I will blot out from them their iniquities, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath;- A reward from the presence of Allah, and from His presence is the best of rewards. Let not the strutting about of the Unbelievers through the land deceive thee: Little is it for enjoyment: Their ultimate abode is Hell: what an evil bed (To lie on)! On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from the presence of Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous. And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book, those who believe in Allah, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, bowing in humility to Allah: They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord, and Allah is swift in account. O ye who believe! Persevere in patience and constancy; vie in such perseverance; strengthen each other; and fear Allah; that ye may prosper. ",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yusuf","A.L.R. These are the symbols (or Verses) of the perspicuous Book. We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur´an, in order that ye may learn wisdom. We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal to thee this (portion of the) Qur´an: before this, thou too was among those who knew it not. Behold! Joseph said to his father: O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me! Said (the father): My (dear) little son! relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is to man an avowed enemy! Thus will thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of stories (and events) and perfect His favour to thee and to the posterity of Jacob - even as He perfected it to thy fathers Abraham and Isaac aforetime! for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (or symbols) for seekers (after Truth). They said: Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we: But we are a goodly body! really our father is obviously wandering (in his mind)! Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some (unknown) land, that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone: (there will be time enough) for you to be righteous after that! Said one of them: Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers. They said: O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph,- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers? Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him. (Jacob) said: Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him. They said: If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves! So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): ´Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not´ Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping. They said: O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him.... But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth. They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is Allah (alone) Whose help can be sought.. Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well)...He said: Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man! So they concealed him as a treasure! But Allah knoweth well all that they do! The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him! The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: Make his stay (among us) honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son. Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not. When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right. But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: Now come, thou (dear one)! He said: Allah forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong! And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified. So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: What is the (fitting) punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or a grievous chastisement? He said: It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self. And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus):- If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar! But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar, and he is telling the truth! So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- (her husband) said: Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare! O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault! Ladies said in the City: The wife of the (great) ´Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his (true) self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray. When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), Come out before them. When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, Allah preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel! She said: There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his (true) self but he did firmly save himself guiltless!....and now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and (what is more) be of the company of the vilest! He said: O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me: Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should (in my youthful folly) feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant. So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things). Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time. Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: I see myself (in a dream) pressing wine. said the other: I see myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof. Tell us (they said) The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that doth good (to all). He said: Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that (even) deny the Hereafter. And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to Allah: that (comes) of the grace of Allah to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful. O my two companions of the prison! (I ask you): are many lords differing among themselves better, or the One Allah, Supreme and Irresistible? If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which Allah hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but Allah: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not... O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head. (so) hath been decreed that matter whereof ye twain do enquire... And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said: Mention me to thy lord. But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years. The king (of Egypt) said: I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions. They said: A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams. But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now bethought him after (so long) a space of time, said: I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore). O Joseph! (he said) O man of truth! Expound to us (the dream) of seven fat kine whom seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and (seven) others withered: that I may return to the people, and that they may understand. (Joseph) said: For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: and the harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear,- except a little, of which ye shall eat. Then will come after that (period) seven dreadful (years), which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them,- (all) except a little which ye shall have (specially) guarded. Then will come after that (period) a year in which the people will have abundant water, and in which they will press (wine and oil). So the king said: Bring ye him unto me. But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, ´What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands´? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare. (The king) said (to the ladies): What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Joseph from his (true) self? The ladies said: Allah preserve us! no evil know we against him! Said the ´Aziz´s wife: Now is the truth manifest (to all): it was I who sought to seduce him from his (true) self: He is indeed of those who are (ever) true (and virtuous). This (say I), in order that He may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones. Nor do I absolve my own self (of blame): the (human) soul is certainly prone to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. So the king said: Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serve about my own person. Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: Be assured this day, thou art, before our own presence, with rank firmly established, and fidelity fully proved! (Joseph) said: Set me over the store-houses of the land: I will indeed guard them, as one that knows (their importance). Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possession therein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good. But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe, and are constant in righteousness. Then came Joseph´s brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them, but they knew him not. And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he said: Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do provide the best hospitality? Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall ye (even) come near me. They said: We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father: Indeed we shall do it. And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might come back. Now when they returned to their father, they said: O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him. He said: Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime? But Allah is the best to take care (of him), and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy! Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel´s load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity. (Jacob) said: Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me, in Allah´s name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless). And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: Over all that we say, be Allah the witness and guardian! Further he said: O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him. And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity of Jacob´s soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not. Now when they came into Joseph´s presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings. At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother´s saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt! They said, turning towards them: What is it that ye miss? They said: We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it. (The brothers) said: By Allah! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves! (The Egyptians) said: What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied? They said: The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers! So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother´s baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing. They said: If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him). But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert! They said: O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good. He said: Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully. Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah´s name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command. Turn ye back to your father, and say, ´O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen! ´Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth.´ Jacob said: Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom. And he turned away from them, and said: How great is my grief for Joseph! And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy. They said: By Allah! (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die! He said: I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not... O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah´s Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah´s Soothing Mercy, except those who have no faith. Then, when they came (back) into (Joseph´s) presence they said: O exalted one! distress has seized us and our family: we have (now) brought but scanty capital: so pay us full measure, (we pray thee), and treat it as charity to us: for Allah doth reward the charitable. He said: Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother, not knowing (what ye were doing)? They said: Art thou indeed Joseph? He said, I am Joseph, and this is my brother: Allah has indeed been gracious to us (all): behold, he that is righteous and patient,- never will Allah suffer the reward to be lost, of those who do right. They said: By Allah! indeed has Allah preferred thee above us, and we certainly have been guilty of sin! He said: This day let no reproach be (cast) on you: Allah will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy! Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see (clearly). Then come ye (here) to me together with all your family. When the caravan left (Egypt), their father said: I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph: Nay, think me not a dotard. They said: By Allah! truly thou art in thine old wandering mind. Then when the bearer of the good news came, He cast (the shirt) over his face, and he forthwith regained clear sight. He said: Did I not say to you, ´I know from Allah that which ye know not?´ They said: O our father! ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we were truly at fault. He said: Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you: for he is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for his parents with himself, and said: Enter ye Egypt (all) in safety if it please Allah. And he raised his parents high on the throne (of dignity), and they fell down in prostration, (all) before him. He said: O my father! this is the fulfilment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you (all here) out of the desert, (even) after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily my Lord understandeth best the mysteries of all that He planneth to do, for verily He is full of knowledge and wisdom. O my Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on me some power, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams and events,- O Thou Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Take Thou my soul (at death) as one submitting to Thy will (as a Muslim), and unite me with the righteous. Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen, which We reveal by inspiration unto thee; nor wast thou (present) with them then when they concerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots. Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have, however ardently thou dost desire it. And no reward dost thou ask of them for this: it is no less than a message for all creatures. And how many Signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn (their faces) away from them! And most of them believe not in Allah without associating (other as partners) with Him! Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the wrath of Allah,- or of the coming against them of the (final) Hour all of a sudden while they perceive not? Say thou: This is my way: I do invite unto Allah,- on evidence clear as the seeing with one´s eyes,- I and whoever follows me. Glory to Allah! and never will I join gods with Allah! Nor did We send before thee (as messengers) any but men, whom we did inspire,- (men) living in human habitations. Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? But the home of the hereafter is best, for those who do right. Will ye not then understand? (Respite will be granted) until, when the messengers give up hope (of their people) and (come to) think that they were treated as liars, there reaches them Our help, and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will be warded off our punishment from those who are in sin. There is, in their stories, instruction for men endued with understanding. It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it,- a detailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe. ",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Duhan","Ha-Mim. By the Book that makes things clear;- We sent it down during a Blessed Night: for We (ever) wish to warn (against Evil). In the (Night) is made distinct every affair of wisdom, By command, from Our Presence. For We (ever) send (revelations), As Mercy from thy Lord: for He hears and knows (all things); The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all between them, if ye (but) have an assured faith. There is no god but He: It is He Who gives life and gives death,- The Lord and Cherisher to you and your earliest ancestors. Yet they play about in doubt. Then watch thou for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke (or mist) plainly visible, Enveloping the people: this will be a Penalty Grievous. (They will say:) Our Lord! remove the Penalty from us, for we do really believe! How shall the message be (effectual) for them, seeing that an Messenger explaining things clearly has (already) come to them,- Yet they turn away from him and say: Tutored (by others), a man possessed! We shall indeed remove the Penalty for a while, (but) truly ye will revert (to your ways). One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught: We will indeed (then) exact Retribution! We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them a messenger most honourable, Saying: Restore to me the Servants of Allah: I am to you an messenger worthy of all trust; And be not arrogant as against Allah: for I come to you with authority manifest. For me, I have sought safety with my Lord and your Lord, against your injuring me. If ye believe me not, at least keep yourselves away from me. (But they were aggressive:) then he cried to his Lord: These are indeed a people given to sin. (The reply came:) March forth with My Servants by night: for ye are sure to be pursued. And leave the sea as a furrow (divided): for they are a host (destined) to be drowned. How many were the gardens and springs they left behind, And corn-fields and noble buildings, And wealth (and conveniences of life), wherein they had taken such delight! Thus (was their end)! And We made other people inherit (those things)! And neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them: nor were they given a respite (again). We did deliver aforetime the Children of Israel from humiliating Punishment, Inflicted by Pharaoh, for he was arrogant (even) among inordinate transgressors. And We chose them aforetime above the nations, knowingly, And granted them Signs in which there was a manifest trial As to these (Quraish), they say forsooth: There is nothing beyond our first death, and we shall not be raised again. Then bring (back) our forefathers, if what ye say is true! What! Are they better than the people of Tubba and those who were before them? We destroyed them because they were guilty of sin. We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, merely in (idle) sport: We created them not except for just ends: but most of them do not understand. Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them,- The Day when no protector can avail his client in aught, and no help can they receive, Except such as receive Allah´s Mercy: for He is Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. Verily the tree of Zaqqum Will be the food of the Sinful,- Like molten brass; it will boil in their insides. Like the boiling of scalding water. (A voice will cry: Seize ye him and drag him into the midst of the Blazing Fire! Then pour over his head the Penalty of Boiling Water, Taste thou (this)! Truly wast thou mighty, full of honour! Truly this is what ye used to doubt! As to the Righteous (they will be) in a position of Security, Among Gardens and Springs; Dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade, they will face each other; So; and We shall join them to fair women with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes. There can they call for every kind of fruit in peace and security; Nor will they there taste Death, except the first death; and He will preserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire,- As a Bounty from thy Lord! that will be the supreme achievement! Verily, We have made this (Qur´an) easy, in thy tongue, in order that they may give heed. So wait thou and watch; for they (too) are waiting. ",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Casiye","Ha-Mim. The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. Verily in the heavens and the earth, are Signs for those who believe. And in the creation of yourselves and the fact that animals are scattered (through the earth), are Signs for those of assured Faith. And in the alternation of Night and Day, and the fact that Allah sends down Sustenance from the sky, and revives therewith the earth after its death, and in the change of the winds,- are Signs for those that are wise. Such are the Signs of Allah, which We rehearse to thee in Truth; then in what exposition will they believe after (rejecting) Allah and His Signs? Woe to each sinful dealer in Falsehoods: He hears the Signs of Allah rehearsed to him, yet is obstinate and lofty, as if he had not heard them: then announce to him a Penalty Grievous! And when he learns something of Our Signs, he takes them in jest: for such there will be a humiliating Penalty. In front of them is Hell: and of no profit to them is anything they may have earned, nor any protectors they may have taken to themselves besides Allah: for them is a tremendous Penalty. This is (true) Guidance and for those who reject the Signs of their Lord, is a grievous Penalty of abomination. It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through it by His command, that ye may seek of his Bounty, and that ye may be grateful. And He has subjected to you, as from Him, all that is in the heavens and on earth: Behold, in that are Signs indeed for those who reflect. Tell those who believe, to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of Allah: It is for Him to recompense (for good or ill) each People according to what they have earned. If any one does a righteous deed, it ensures to the benefit of his own soul; if he does evil, it works against (his own soul). In the end will ye (all) be brought back to your Lord. We did aforetime grant to the Children of Israel the Book the Power of Command, and Prophethood; We gave them, for Sustenance, things good and pure; and We favoured them above the nations. And We granted them Clear Signs in affairs (of Religion): it was only after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms, through insolent envy among themselves. Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to those matters in which they set up differences. Then We put thee on the (right) Way of Religion: so follow thou that (Way), and follow not the desires of those who know not. They will be of no use to thee in the sight of Allah: it is only Wrong-doers (that stand as) protectors, one to another: but Allah is the Protector of the Righteous. These are clear evidences to men and a Guidance and Mercy to those of assured Faith. What! Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds,- that equal will be their life and their death? Ill is the judgment that they make. Allah created the heavens and the earth for just ends, and in order that each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned, and none of them be wronged. Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire? Allah has, knowing (him as such), left him astray, and sealed his hearing and his heart (and understanding), and put a cover on his sight. Who, then, will guide him after Allah (has withdrawn Guidance)? Will ye not then receive admonition? And they say: What is there but our life in this world? We shall die and we live, and nothing but time can destroy us. But of that they have no knowledge: they merely conjecture: And when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them their argument is nothing but this: They say, Bring (back) our forefathers, if what ye say is true! Say: It is Allah Who gives you life, then gives you death; then He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt: But most men do not understand. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and the Day that the Hour of Judgment is established,- that Day will the dealers in Falsehood perish! And thou wilt see every sect bowing the knee: Every sect will be called to its Record: This Day shall ye be recompensed for all that ye did! This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on Record all that ye did. Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see. But as to those who rejected Allah, (to them will be said): Were not Our Signs rehearsed to you? But ye were arrogant, and were a people given to sin! And when it was said that the promise of Allah was true, and that the Hour- there was no doubt about its (coming), ye used to say, ´We know not what is the hour: we only think it is an idea, and we have no firm assurance.´ Then will appear to them the evil (fruits) of what they did, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! It will also be said: This Day We will forget you as ye forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! and your abode is the Fire, and no helpers have ye! This, because ye used to take the Signs of Allah in jest, and the life of the world deceived you: (From) that Day, therefore, they shall not be taken out thence, nor shall they be received into Grace. Then Praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth,- Lord and Cherisher of all the Worlds! To Him be glory throughout the heavens and the earth: and He is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom! ",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hud","A. L. R. (This is) a Book, with verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning), further explained in detail,- from One Who is Wise and Well-acquainted (with all things): (It teacheth) that ye should worship none but Allah. (Say): Verily I am (sent) unto you from Him to warn and to bring glad tidings: (And to preach thus), ´Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment, good (and true), for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit! But if ye turn away, then I fear for you the penalty of a great day: ´To Allah is your return, and He hath power over all things.´ Behold! they fold up their hearts, that they may lie hid from Him! Ah even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knoweth what they conceal, and what they reveal: for He knoweth well the (inmost secrets) of the hearts. There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on Allah: He knoweth the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But if thou wert to say to them, Ye shall indeed be raised up after death, the Unbelievers would be sure to say, This is nothing but obvious sorcery! If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, What keeps it back? Ah! On the day it (actually) reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at! If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold! he is in despair and (falls into) blasphemy. But if We give him a taste of (Our) favours after adversity hath touched him, he is sure to say, All evil has departed from me: Behold! he falls into exultation and pride. Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness (of sins) and a great reward. Perchance thou mayest (feel the inclination) to give up a part of what is revealed unto thee, and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say, Why is not a treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him? But thou art there only to warn! It is Allah that arrangeth all affairs! Or they may say, He forged it, Say, Bring ye then ten suras forged, like unto it, and call (to your aid) whomsoever ye can, other than Allah!- If ye speak the truth! If then they (your false gods) answer not your (call), know ye that this revelation is sent down (replete) with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god but He! will ye even then submit (to Islam)? Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter,- to them we shall pay (the price of) their deeds therein,- without diminution. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vain are the designs they frame therein, and of no effect and the deeds that they do! Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe! Who doth more wrong than those who invent a life against Allah? They will be turned back to the presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, These are the ones who lied against their Lord! Behold! the Curse of Allah is on those who do wrong!- Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: these were they who denied the Hereafter! They will in no wise frustrate (His design) on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah! Their penalty will be doubled! They lost the power to hear, and they did not see! They are the ones who have lost their own souls: and the (fancies) they invented have left them in the lurch! Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter! But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord,- They will be companions of the gardens, to dwell therein for aye! These two kinds (of men) may be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will ye not then take heed? We sent Noah to his people (with a mission): I have come to you with a Clear Warning: That ye serve none but Allah: Verily I do fear for you the penalty of a grievous day. But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: We see (in) thee nothing but a man like ourselves: Nor do we see that any follow thee but the meanest among us, in judgment immature: Nor do we see in you (all) any merit above us: in fact we thing ye are liars! He said: O my people! See ye if (it be that) I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it? And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from none but Allah: But I will not drive away (in contempt) those who believe: for verily they are to meet their Lord, and ye I see are the ignorant ones! And O my people! who would help me against Allah if I drove them away? Will ye not then take heed? I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes do despise that Allah will not grant them (all) that is good: Allah knoweth best what is in their souls: I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer. They said: O Noah! thou hast disputed with us, and (much) hast thou prolonged the dispute with us: now bring upon us what thou threatenest us with, if thou speakest the truth!? He said: Truly, Allah will bring it on you if He wills,- and then, ye will not be able to frustrate it! Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you (good) counsel, if it be that Allah willeth to leave you astray: He is your Lord! and to Him will ye return! Or do they say, He has forged it? Say: If I had forged it, on me were my sin! and I am free of the sins of which ye are guilty! It was revealed to Noah: None of thy people will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their (evil) deeds. But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood). Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said: If ye ridicule us now, we (in our turn) can look down on you with ridicule likewise! But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame,- on whom will be unloosed a penalty lasting: At length, behold! there came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, and your family - except those against whom the word has already gone forth,- and the Believers. but only a few believed with him. So he said: Embark ye on the Ark, In the name of Allah, whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful! So the Ark floated with them on the waves (towering) like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (from the rest): O my son! embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers! The son replied: I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water. Noah said: This day nothing can save, from the command of Allah, any but those on whom He hath mercy! And the waves came between them, and the son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood. Then the word went forth: O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold (thy rain)! and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: Away with those who do wrong! And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges! He said: O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou act like the ignorant! Noah said: O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be lost! The word came: O Noah! Come down (from the Ark) with peace from Us, and blessing on thee and on some of the peoples (who will spring) from those with thee: but (there will be other) peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us. Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous. To the ´Ad People (We sent) Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. (Your other gods) ye do nothing but invent! O my people! I ask of you no reward for this (Message). My reward is from none but Him who created me: Will ye not then understand? And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him (in repentance): He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strength to your strength: so turn ye not back in sin! They said: O Hud! No Clear (Sign) that hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee! We say nothing but that (perhaps) some of our gods may have seized thee with imbecility. He said: I call Allah to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing, to Him, Other gods as partners! so scheme (your worst) against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its fore-lock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path. If ye turn away,- I (at least) have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things. So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty. Such were the ´Ad People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His messengers; And followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor. And they were pursued by a Curse in this life,- and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the ´Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were ´Ad the people of Hud! To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: O my people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer. They said: O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto! dost thou (now) forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us. He said: O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition? And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on Allah´s (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you! But they did ham-string her. So he said: Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied! When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will. The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning,- As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamud rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were the Thamud! There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, Peace! He answered, Peace! and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf. But when he saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not: We have been sent against the people of Lut. And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob. She said: Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing! They said: Dost thou wonder at Allah´s decree? The grace of Allah and His blessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory! When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with us for Lut´s people. For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to Allah. O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back! When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: This is a distressful day. And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man? They said: Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want! He said: Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support. (The Messengers) said: O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh? When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,- Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong! To the Madyan People (We sent) Shu´aib, one of their own brethren: he said: O my people! worship Allah: Ye have no other god but Him. And give not short measure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will compass (you) all round. And O my people! give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to do mischief. That which is left you by Allah is best for you, if ye (but) believed! but I am not set over you to keep watch! They said: O Shu´aib! Does thy (religion of) prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded! He said: O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself? I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from Allah. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look. And O my people! let not my dissent (from you) cause you to sin, lest ye suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you! But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him (in repentance): For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness. They said: O Shu´aib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, we should certainly have stoned thee! for thou hast among us no great position! He said: O my people! is then my family of more consideration with you than Allah? For ye cast Him away behind your backs (with contempt). But verily my Lord encompasseth on all sides all that ye do! And O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): Soon will ye know who it is on whom descends the penalty of ignominy; and who is a liar! and watch ye! for I too am watching with you! When Our decree issued, We saved Shu´aib and those who believed with him, by (special) mercy from Ourselves: But the (mighty) blast did seize the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,- As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyan were removed (from sight) as were removed the Thamud! And we sent Moses, with Our Clear (Signs) and an authority manifest, Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right (guide). He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into the Fire (as cattle are led to water): But woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led! And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful is the gift which shall be given (unto them)! These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down (by the sickle of time). It was not We that wronged them: They wronged their own souls: the deities, other than Allah, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition! Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement. In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter: that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day of Testimony. Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed. The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those (gathered) some will be wretched and some will be blessed. Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the (sure) accomplisher of what He planneth. And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: a gift without break. Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before (them): but verily We shall pay them back (in full) their portion without (the least) abatement. We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had it not been that a word had gone forth before from thy Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it. And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back (in full the recompense) of their deeds: for He knoweth well all that they do. Therefore stand firm (in the straight Path) as thou art commanded,- thou and those who with thee turn (unto Allah); and transgress not (from the Path): for He seeth well all that ye do. And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than Allah, nor shall ye be helped. And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that are evil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember (their Lord): And be steadfast in patience; for verily Allah will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish. Why were there not, among the generations before you, persons possessed of balanced good sense, prohibiting (men) from mischief in the earth - except a few among them whom We saved (from harm)? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin. Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong-doing, if its members were likely to mend. If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but they will not cease to dispute. Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together. All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it We make firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe. Say to those who do not believe: Do what ever ye can: We shall do our part; And wait ye! We too shall wait. To Allah do belong the unseen (secrets) of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goeth back every affair (for decision): then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.

"Kasas","Ta. Sin. Mim. These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear. We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, for people who believe. Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections, depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew, but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief. And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders (in Faith) and make them heirs, To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman, and their hosts, at their hands, the very things against which they were taking precautions. So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: Suckle (thy child), but when thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Our messengers. Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended) that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were men of sin. The wife of Pharaoh said: (Here is) joy of the eye, for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And they perceived not (what they were doing)! But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart (with faith), so that she might remain a (firm) believer. And she said to the sister of (Moses), Follow him so she (the sister) watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not. And we ordained that he refused suck at first, until (His sister came up and) said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?... Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true: but most of them do not understand. When he reached full age, and was firmly established (in life), We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good. And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and he found there two men fighting,- one of his own religion, and the other, of his foes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe, and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads! He prayed: O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me! So (Allah) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. He said: O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never shall I be a help to those who sin! So he saw the morning in the city, looking about, in a state of fear, when behold, the man who had, the day before, sought his help called aloud for his help (again). Moses said to him: Thou art truly, it is clear, a quarrelsome fellow! Then, when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them, that man said: O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land, and not to be one who sets things right! And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the City. He said: O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to slay thee: so get thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice. He therefore got away therefrom, looking about, in a state of fear. He prayed O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing. Then, when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan, he said: I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path. And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks), and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you? They said: We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): And our father is a very old man. So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade, and said:O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou dost send me! Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him, walking bashfully. She said: My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered (our flocks) for us. So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people. Said one of the (damsels): O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty.... He said: I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on condition that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years, it will be (grace) from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me, indeed, if Allah wills, one of the righteous. He said: Be that (the agreement) between me and thee: whichever of the two terms I fulfil, let there be no ill-will to me. Be Allah a witness to what we say. Now when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you from there some information, or a burning firebrand, that ye may warm yourselves. But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground: O Moses! Verily I am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.... Now do thou throw thy rod! but when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: O Moses! (It was said), Draw near, and fear not: for thou art of those who are secure. Move thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm), and draw thy hand close to thy side (to guard) against fear. Those are the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: for truly they are a people rebellious and wicked. He said: O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear lest they slay me. And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper, to confirm (and strengthen) me: for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood. He said: We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother, and invest you both with authority, so they shall not be able to touch you: with Our Sign shall ye triumph,- you two as well as those who follow you. When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said: This is nothing but sorcery faked up: never did we head the like among our fathers of old! Moses said: My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper. Pharaoh said: O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore, O Haman! light me a (kiln to bake bricks) out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar! And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason,- He and his hosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us! So We seized him and his hosts, and We flung them into the sea: Now behold what was the end of those who did wrong! And we made them (but) leaders inviting to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgment no help shall they find. in this world We made a curse to follow them and on the Day of Judgment they will be among the loathed (and despised). We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations, (to give) Insight to men, and guidance and Mercy, that they might receive admonition. Thou wast not on the Western side when We decreed the Commission to Moses, nor wast thou a witness (of those events). But We raised up (new) generations, and long were the ages that passed over them; but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan, rehearsing Our Signs to them; but it is We Who send messengers (with inspiration). Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tur when we called (to Moses). Yet (art thou sent) as Mercy from thy Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before thee: in order that they may receive admonition. If (We had) not (sent thee to the Quraish),- in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth, they might say: Our Lord! why didst Thou not sent us a messenger? We should then have followed Thy Signs and been amongst those who believe! But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, Why are not (Signs) sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses? Do they not then reject (the Signs) which were formerly sent to Moses? They say: Two kinds of sorcery, each assisting the other! And they say: For us, we reject all (such things)! Say: Then bring ye a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than either of them, that I may follow it! (do), if ye are truthful! But if they hearken not to thee, know that they only follow their own lusts: and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts, devoid of guidance from Allah? for Allah guides not people given to wrong-doing. Now have We caused the Word to reach them themselves, in order that they may receive admonition. Those to whom We sent the Book before this,- they do believe in this (revelation): And when it is recited to them, they say: We believe therein, for it is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims (bowing to Allah´s Will) from before this. Twice will they be given their reward, for that they have persevered, that they avert Evil with Good, and that they spend (in charity) out of what We have given them. And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant. It is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one, whom thou lovest; but Allah guides those whom He will and He knows best those who receive guidance. They say: If we were to follow the guidance with thee, we should be snatched away from our land. Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary, to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds,- a provision from Ourselves? but most of them understand not. And how many populations We destroyed, which exulted in their life (of ease and plenty)! now those habitations of theirs, after them, are deserted,- All but a (miserable) few! and We are their heirs! Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to its centre a messenger, rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy a population except when its members practise iniquity. The (material) things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof; but that which is with Allah is better and more enduring: will ye not then be wise? Are (these two) alike?- one to whom We have made a goodly promise, and who is going to reach its (fulfilment), and one to whom We have given the good things of this life, but who, on the Day of Judgment, is to be among those brought up (for punishment)? That Day (Allah) will call to them, and say Where are my ´partners´?- whom ye imagined (to be such)? Those against whom the charge will be proved, will say: Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray, as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) in Thy presence: it was not us they worshipped. It will be said (to them): Call upon your ´partners´ (for help) :they will call upon them, but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty (before them); (how they will wish) ´if only they had been open to guidance!´ That Day (Allah) will call to them, and say: What was the answer ye gave to the messengers? Then the (whole) story that Day will seem obscure to them (like light to the blind) and they will not be able (even) to question each other. But any that (in this life) had repented, believed, and worked righteousness, will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation. Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to Allah! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)! And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal. And He is Allah: There is no god but He. To Him be praise, at the first and at the last: for Him is the Command, and to Him shall ye (all) be brought back. Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the night perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you enlightenment? Will ye not then hearken? Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day of Judgment, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you a night in which ye can rest? Will ye not then see? It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day,- that ye may rest therein, and that ye may seek of his Grace;- and in order that ye may be grateful. The Day that He will call on them, He will say: Where are my ´partners´? whom ye imagined (to be such)? And from each people shall We draw a witness, and We shall say: Produce your Proof: then shall they know that the Truth is in Allah (alone), and the (lies) which they invented will leave them in lurch. Qarun was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards them: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men, behold, his people said to him: Exult not, for Allah loveth not those who exult (in riches). But seek, with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allah has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief. He said: This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have. Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, before him, (whole) generations,- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected? but the wicked are not called (immediately) to account for their sins. So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his wordly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune! But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: Alas for you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere (in good). Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against Allah, nor could he defend himself. And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that Allah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper. That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high-handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous. If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds. Verily He Who ordained the Qur´an for thee, will bring thee back to the Place of Return. Say: My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance, and who is in manifest error. And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as a Mercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those who reject (Allah´s Message). And let nothing keep thee back from the Signs of Allah after they have been revealed to thee: and invite (men) to thy Lord, and be not of the company of those who join gods with Allah. And call not, besides Allah, on another god. There is no god but He. Everything (that exists) will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will ye (all) be brought back.

"Yasin","Ya Sin. By the Qur´an, full of Wisdom,- Thou art indeed one of the messengers, On a Straight Way. It is a Revelation sent down by (Him), the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. In order that thou mayest admonish a people, whose fathers had received no admonition, and who therefore remain heedless (of the Signs of Allah). The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do not believe. We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins, so that their heads are forced up (and they cannot see). And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them, and further, We have covered them up; so that they cannot see. The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe. Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the (Lord) Most Gracious, unseen: give such a one, therefore, good tidings, of Forgiveness and a Reward most generous. Verily We shall give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before and that which they leave behind, and of all things have We taken account in a clear Book (of evidence). Set forth to them, by way of a parable, the (story of) the Companions of the City. Behold!, there came messengers to it. When We (first) sent to them two messengers, they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said, Truly, we have been sent on a mission to you. The (people) said: Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie. They said: Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you: And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message. The (people) said: for us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not, we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us. They said: Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen). If ye are admonished? Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds! Then there came running, from the farthest part of the City, a man, saying, O my people! Obey the messengers: Obey those who ask no reward of you (for themselves), and who have themselves received Guidance. It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me, and to Whom ye shall (all) be brought back. Shall I take (other) gods besides Him? If (Allah) Most Gracious should intend some adversity for me, of no use whatever will be their intercession for me, nor can they deliver me. I would indeed, if I were to do so, be in manifest Error. For me, I have faith in the Lord of you (all): listen, then, to me! It was said: Enter thou the Garden. He said: Ah me! Would that my People knew (what I know)!- For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among those held in honour! And We sent not down against his People, after him, any hosts from heaven, nor was it needful for Us so to do. It was no more than a single mighty Blast, and behold! they were (like ashes) quenched and silent. Ah! Alas for (My) Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but they mock him! See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them will they return: But each one of them all - will be brought before Us (for judgment). A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat. And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines, and We cause springs to gush forth therein: That they may enjoy the fruits of this (artistry): It was not their hands that made this: will they not then give thanks? Glory to Allah, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces, as well as their own (human) kind and (other) things of which they have no knowledge. And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day, and behold they are plunged in darkness; And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the decree of (Him), the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing. And the Moon,- We have measured for her mansions (to traverse) till she returns like the old (and withered) lower part of a date-stalk. It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law). And a Sign for them is that We bore their race (through the Flood) in the loaded Ark; And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride. If it were Our Will, We could drown them: then would there be no helper (to hear their cry), nor could they be delivered, Except by way of Mercy from Us, and by way of (world) convenience (to serve them) for a time. When they are told, Fear ye that which is before you and that which will be after you, in order that ye may receive Mercy, (they turn back). Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom. And when they are told, Spend ye of (the bounties) with which Allah has provided you, the Unbelievers say to those who believe: Shall we then feed those whom, if Allah had so willed, He would have fed, (Himself)?- Ye are in nothing but manifest error. Further, they say, When will this promise (come to pass), if what ye say is true? They will not (have to) wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves! No (chance) will they then have, by will, to dispose (of their affairs), nor to return to their own people! The trumpet shall be sounded, when behold! from the sepulchres (men) will rush forth to their Lord! They will say: Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds of repose?... (A voice will say:) This is what (Allah) Most Gracious had promised. And true was the word of the messengers! It will be no more than a single Blast, when lo! they will all be brought up before Us! Then, on that Day, not a soul will be wronged in the least, and ye shall but be repaid the meeds of your past Deeds. Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that they do; They and their associates will be in groves of (cool) shade, reclining on Thrones (of dignity); (Every) fruit (enjoyment) will be there for them; they shall have whatever they call for; Peace! - a word (of salutation) from a Lord Most Merciful! And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day! Did I not enjoin on you, O ye Children of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?- And that ye should worship Me, (for that) this was the Straight Way? But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not, then, understand? This is the Hell of which ye were (repeatedly) warned! Embrace ye the (fire) this Day, for that ye (persistently) rejected (Truth). That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak to us, and their feet bear witness, to all that they did. If it had been our Will, We could surely have blotted out their eyes; then should they have run about groping for the Path, but how could they have seen? And if it had been Our Will, We could have transformed them (to remain) in their places; then should they have been unable to move about, nor could they have returned (after error). If We grant long life to any, We cause him to be reversed in nature: Will they not then understand? We have not instructed the (Prophet) in Poetry, nor is it meet for him: this is no less than a Message and a Qur´an making things clear: That it may give admonition to any (who are) alive, and that the charge may be proved against those who reject (Truth). See they not that it is We Who have created for them - among the things which Our hands have fashioned - cattle, which are under their dominion?- And that We have subjected them to their (use)? of them some do carry them and some they eat: And they have (other) profits from them (besides), and they get (milk) to drink. Will they not then be grateful? Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah, (hoping) that they might be helped! They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned). Let not their speech, then, grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose. Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he (stands forth) as an open adversary! And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own (origin and) Creation: He says, Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)? Say, He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He is Well-versed in every kind of creation!- The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold! ye kindle therewith (your own fires)! Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof? - Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge (infinite)! Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, be, and it is! So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him will ye be all brought back. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Mumin","Ha Mim The revelation of this Book is from Allah, Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge,- Who forgiveth sin, accepteth repentance, is strict in punishment, and hath a long reach (in all things). there is no god but He: to Him is the final goal. None can dispute about the Signs of Allah but the Unbelievers. Let not, then, their strutting about through the land deceive thee! But (there were people) before them, who denied (the Signs),- the People of Noah, and the Confederates (of Evil) after them; and every People plotted against their prophet, to seize him, and disputed by means of vanities, therewith to condemn the Truth; but it was I that seized them! and how (terrible) was My Requital! Thus was the Decree of thy Lord proved true against the Unbelievers; that truly they are Companions of the Fire! Those who sustain the Throne (of Allah) and those around it Sing Glory and Praise to their Lord; believe in Him; and implore Forgiveness for those who believe: Our Lord! Thy Reach is over all things, in Mercy and Knowledge. Forgive, then, those who turn in Repentance, and follow Thy Path; and preserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire! And grant, our Lord! that they enter the Gardens of Eternity, which Thou hast promised to them, and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their posterity! For Thou art (He), the Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom. And preserve them from (all) ills; and any whom Thou dost preserve from ills that Day,- on them wilt Thou have bestowed Mercy indeed: and that will be truly (for them) the highest Achievement. The Unbelievers will be addressed: Greater was the aversion of Allah to you than (is) your aversion to yourselves, seeing that ye were called to the Faith and ye used to refuse. They will say: Our Lord! twice hast Thou made us without life, and twice hast Thou given us Life! Now have we recognised our sins: Is there any way out (of this)? (The answer will be:) This is because, when Allah was invoked as the Only (object of worship), ye did reject Faith, but when partners were joined to Him, ye believed! the Command is with Allah, Most High, Most Great! He it is Who showeth you his Signs, and sendeth down sustenance for you from the sky: but only those receive admonition who turn (to Allah). Call ye, then, upon Allah with sincere devotion to Him, even though the Unbelievers may detest it. Raised high above ranks (or degrees), (He is) the Lord of the Throne (of Authority): by His Command doth He send the Spirit (of inspiration) to any of His servants he pleases, that it may warn (men) of the Day of Mutual Meeting,- The Day whereon they will (all) come forth: not a single thing concerning them is hidden from Allah. Whose will be the dominion that Day? That of Allah, the One the Irresistible! That Day will every soul be requited for what it earned; no injustice will there be that Day, for Allah is Swift in taking account. Warn them of the Day that is (ever) drawing near, when the hearts will (come) right up to the throats to choke (them); No intimate friend nor intercessor will the wrong-doers have, who could be listened to. (Allah) knows of (the tricks) that deceive with the eyes, and all that the hearts (of men) conceal. And Allah will judge with (justice and) Truth: but those whom (men) invoke besides Him, will not (be in a position) to judge at all. Verily it is Allah (alone) Who hears and sees (all things). Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were even superior to them in strength, and in the traces (they have left) in the land: but Allah did call them to account for their sins, and none had they to defend them against Allah. That was because there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs), but they rejected them: So Allah called them to account: for He is Full of Strength, Strict in Punishment. Of old We sent Moses, with Our Signs and an authority manifest, To Pharaoh, Haman, and Qarun; but they called (him) a sorcerer telling lies!... Now, when he came to them in Truth, from Us, they said, Slay the sons of those who believe with him, and keep alive their females, but the plots of Unbelievers (end) in nothing but errors (and delusions)!... Said Pharaoh: Leave me to slay Moses; and let him call on his Lord! What I fear is lest he should change your religion, or lest he should cause mischief to appear in the land! Moses said: I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord (for protection) from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account! A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said: Will ye slay a man because he says, ´My Lord is Allah´?- when he has indeed come to you with Clear (Signs) from your Lord? and if he be a liar, on him is (the sin of) his lie: but, if he is telling the Truth, then will fall on you something of the (calamity) of which he warns you: Truly Allah guides not one who transgresses and lies! O my People! Yours is the dominion this day: Ye have the upper hand in the land: but who will help us from the Punishment of Allah, should it befall us? Pharaoh said: I but point out to you that which I see (myself); Nor do I guide you but to the Path of Right! Then said the man who believed: O my people! Truly I do fear for you something like the Day (of disaster) of the Confederates (in sin)!- Something like the fate of the People of Noah, the ´Ad, and the Thamud, and those who came after them: but Allah never wishes injustice to his Servants. And O my people! I fear for you a Day when there will be Mutual calling (and wailing),- A Day when ye shall turn your backs and flee: No defender shall ye have from Allah: Any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is none to guide... And to you there came Joseph in times gone by, with Clear Signs, but ye ceased not to doubt of the (Mission) for which he had come: At length, when he died, ye said: ´No messenger will Allah send after him.´ thus doth Allah leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt,- (Such) as dispute about the Signs of Allah, without any authority that hath reached them, grievous and odious (is such conduct) in the sight of Allah and of the Believers. Thus doth Allah, seal up every heart - of arrogant and obstinate Transgressors. Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build me a lofty palace, that I may attain the ways and means- The ways and means of (reaching) the heavens, and that I may mount up to the god of Moses: But as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar! Thus was made alluring, in Pharaoh´s eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the Path; and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but perdition (for him). The man who believed said further: O my people! Follow me: I will lead you to the Path of Right. O my people! This life of the present is nothing but (temporary) convenience: It is the Hereafter that is the Home that will last. He that works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof: and he that works a righteous deed - whether man or woman - and is a Believer- such will enter the Garden (of Bliss): Therein will they have abundance without measure. And O my people! How (strange) it is for me to call you to Salvation while ye call me to the Fire! Ye do call upon me to blaspheme against Allah, and to join with Him partners of whom I have no knowledge; and I call you to the Exalted in Power, Who forgives again and again! Without doubt ye do call me to one who is not fit to be called to, whether in this world, or in the Hereafter; our return will be to Allah; and the Transgressors will be Companions of the Fire! Soon will ye remember what I say to you (now), My (own) affair I commit to Allah: for Allah (ever) watches over His Servants. Then Allah saved him from (every) ill that they plotted (against him), but the burnt of the Penalty encompassed on all sides the People of Pharaoh. In front of the Fire will they be brought, morning and evening: And (the sentence will be) on the Day that Judgment will be established: Cast ye the People of Pharaoh into the severest Penalty! Behold, they will dispute with each other in the Fire! The weak ones (who followed) will say to those who had been arrogant, We but followed you: Can ye then take (on yourselves) from us some share of the Fire? Those who had been arrogant will say: We are all in this (Fire)! Truly, Allah has judged between (his) Servants! Those in the Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell: Pray to your Lord to lighten us the Penalty for a day (at least)! They will say: Did there not come to you your messengers with Clear Signs? They will say, Yes. They will reply, Then pray (as ye like)! But the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile wandering) in (mazes of) error! We will, without doubt, help our messengers and those who believe, (both) in this world´s life and on the Day when the Witnesses will stand forth,- The Day when no profit will it be to Wrong-doers to present their excuses, but they will (only) have the Curse and the Home of Misery. We did aforetime give Moses the (Book of) Guidance, and We gave the book in inheritance to the Children of Israel,- A Guide and a Message to men of Understanding. Patiently, then, persevere: for the Promise of Allah is true: and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and celebrate the Praises of thy Lord in the evening and in the morning. Those who dispute about the signs of Allah without any authority bestowed on them,- there is nothing in their breasts but (the quest of) greatness, which they shall never attain to: seek refuge, then, in Allah: It is He Who hears and sees (all things). Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater (matter) than the creation of men: Yet most men understand not. Not equal are the blind and those who (clearly) see: Nor are (equal) those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and those who do evil. Little do ye learn by admonition! The Hour will certainly come: Therein is no doubt: Yet most men believe not. And your Lord says: Call on Me; I will answer your (Prayer): but those who are too arrogant to serve Me will surely find themselves in Hell - in humiliation! It is Allah Who has made the Night for you, that ye may rest therein, and the days as that which helps (you) to see. Verily Allah is full of Grace and Bounty to men: yet most men give no thanks. Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth! Thus are deluded those who are wont to reject the Signs of Allah. It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place, and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape- and made your shapes beautiful,- and has provided for you Sustenance, of things pure and good;- such is Allah your Lord. So Glory to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! He is the Living (One): There is no god but He: Call upon Him, giving Him sincere devotion. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds! Say: I have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides Allah,- seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord; and I have been commanded to bow (in Islam) to the Lord of the Worlds. It is He Who has created you from dust then from a sperm-drop, then from a leech-like clot; then does he get you out (into the light) as a child: then lets you (grow and) reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old,- though of you there are some who die before;- and lets you reach a Term appointed; in order that ye may learn wisdom. It is He Who gives Life and Death; and when He decides upon an affair, He says to it, Be, and it is. Seest thou not those that dispute concerning the Signs of Allah? How are they turned away (from Reality)?- Those who reject the Book and the (revelations) with which We sent our messengers: but soon shall they know,- When the yokes (shall be) round their necks, and the chains; they shall be dragged along- In the boiling fetid fluid: then in the Fire shall they be burned; Then shall it be said to them: Where are the (deities) to which ye gave part-worship- In derogation of Allah? They will reply: They have left us in the lurch: Nay, we invoked not, of old, anything (that had real existence). Thus does Allah leave the Unbelievers to stray. That was because ye were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other than the Truth, and that ye were wont to be insolent. Enter ye the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is (this) abode of the arrogant! So persevere in patience; for the Promise of Allah is true: and whether We show thee (in this life) some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul (to Our Mercy) (before that),-(in any case) it is to Us that they shall (all) return. We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee. It was not (possible) for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah: but when the Command of Allah issued, the matter was decided in truth and justice, and there perished, there and then those who stood on Falsehoods. It is Allah Who made cattle for you, that ye may use some for riding and some for food; And there are (other) advantages in them for you (besides); that ye may through them attain to any need (there may be) in your hearts; and on them and on ships ye are carried. And He shows you (always) His Signs: then which of the Signs of Allah will ye deny? Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces (they have left) in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them. For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs, they exulted in such knowledge (and skill) as they had; but that very (Wrath) at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in. But when they saw Our Punishment, they said: We believe in Allah,- the one Allah - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him. But their professing the Faith when they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. (Such has been) Allah´s Way of dealing with His Servants (from the most ancient times). And even thus did the Rejecters of Allah perish (utterly)! ",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Rum","A. L. M. The Roman Empire has been defeated- In a land close by; but they, (even) after (this) defeat of theirs, will soon be victorious- Within a few years. With Allah is the Decision, in the past and in the Future: on that Day shall the Believers rejoice- With the help of Allah. He helps whom He will, and He is exalted in might, most merciful. (It is) the promise of Allah. Never does Allah depart from His promise: but most men understand not. They know but the outer (things) in the life of this world: but of the End of things they are heedless. Do they not reflect in their own minds? Not but for just ends and for a term appointed, did Allah create the heavens and the earth, and all between them: yet are there truly many among men who deny the meeting with their Lord (at the Resurrection)! Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done: there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs). (Which they rejected, to their own destruction): It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls. In the long run evil in the extreme will be the End of those who do evil; for that they rejected the Signs of Allah, and held them up to ridicule. It is Allah Who begins (the process of) creation; then repeats it; then shall ye be brought back to Him. On the Day that the Hour will be established, the guilty will be struck dumb with despair. No intercessor will they have among their Partners and they will (themselves) reject their Partners. On the Day that the Hour will be established,- that Day shall (all men) be sorted out. Then those who have believed and worked righteous deeds, shall be made happy in a Mead of Delight. And those who have rejected Faith and falsely denied our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter,- such shall be brought forth to Punishment. So (give) glory to Allah, when ye reach eventide and when ye rise in the morning; Yea, to Him be praise, in the heavens and on earth; and in the late afternoon and when the day begins to decline. It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall ye be brought out (from the dead). Among His Signs in this, that He created you from dust; and then,- behold, ye are men scattered (far and wide)! And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect. And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those who know. And among His Signs is the sleep that ye take by night and by day, and the quest that ye (make for livelihood) out of His Bounty: verily in that are signs for those who hearken. And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise. And among His Signs is this, that heaven and earth stand by His Command: then when He calls you, by a single call, from the earth, behold, ye (straightway) come forth. To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him. It is He Who begins (the process of) creation; then repeats it; and for Him it is most easy. To Him belongs the loftiest similitude (we can think of) in the heavens and the earth: for He is Exalted in Might, full of wisdom. He does propound to you a similitude from your own (experience): do ye have partners among those whom your right hands possess, to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you? Do ye fear them as ye fear each other? Thus do we explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand. Nay, the wrong-doers (merely) follow their own lusts, being devoid of knowledge. But who will guide those whom Allah leaves astray? To them there will be no helpers. So set thou thy face steadily and truly to the Faith: (establish) Allah´s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not. Turn ye back in repentance to Him, and fear Him: establish regular prayers, and be not ye among those who join gods with Allah,- Those who split up their Religion, and become (mere) Sects,- each party rejoicing in that which is with itself! When trouble touches men, they cry to their Lord, turning back to Him in repentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself, behold, some of them pay part-worship to other god´s besides their Lord,- (As if) to show their ingratitude for the (favours) We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy (your brief day); but soon will ye know (your folly). Or have We sent down authority to them, which points out to them the things to which they pay part-worship? When We give men a taste of Mercy, they exult thereat: and when some evil afflicts them because of what their (own) hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair! See they not that Allah enlarges the provision and restricts it, to whomsoever He pleases? Verily in that are Signs for those who believe. So give what is due to kindred, the needy, and the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the Countenance, of Allah, and it is they who will prosper. That which ye lay out for increase through the property of (other) people, will have no increase with Allah: but that which ye lay out for charity, seeking the Countenance of Allah, (will increase): it is these who will get a recompense multiplied. It is Allah Who has created you: further, He has provided for your sustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life. Are there any of your (false) Partners who can do any single one of these things? Glory to Him! and high is He above the partners they attribute (to him)! Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned, that (Allah) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil). Say: Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before (you): Most of them worshipped others besides Allah. But set thou thy face to the right Religion before there come from Allah the Day which there is no chance of averting: on that Day shall men be divided (in two). Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who work righteousness will spread their couch (of repose) for themselves (in heaven): That He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds, out of his Bounty. For He loves not those who reject Faith. Among His Signs is this, that He sends the Winds, as heralds of Glad Tidings, giving you a taste of His (Grace and) Mercy,- that the ships may sail (majestically) by His Command and that ye may seek of His Bounty: in order that ye may be grateful. We did indeed send, before thee, messengers to their (respective) peoples, and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who transgressed, We meted out Retribution: and it was due from Us to aid those who believed. It is Allah Who sends the Winds, and they raise the Clouds: then does He spread them in the sky as He wills, and break them into fragments, until thou seest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reach such of his servants as He wills behold, they do rejoice!- Even though, before they received (the rain) - just before this - they were dumb with despair! Then contemplate (O man!) the memorials of Allah´s Mercy!- how He gives life to the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men who are dead: for He has power over all things. And if We (but) send a Wind from which they see (their tilth) turn yellow,- behold, they become, thereafter, Ungrateful (Unbelievers)! So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away. Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying: only those wilt thou make to hear, who believe in Our signs and submit (their wills in Islam). It is Allah Who created you in a state of (helpless) weakness, then gave (you) strength after weakness, then, after strength, gave (you weakness and a hoary head: He creates as He wills, and it is He Who has all knowledge and power. On the Day that the Hour (of Reckoning) will be established, the transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they used to being deluded! But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: Indeed ye did tarry, within Allah´s Decree, to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection: but ye - ye were not aware! So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors, nor will they be invited (then) to seek grace (by repentance). verily We have propounded for men, in this Qur´an every kind of Parable: But if thou bring to them any Sign, the Unbelievers are sure to say, Ye do nothing but talk vanities. Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who understand not. So patiently persevere: for verily the promise of Allah is true: nor let those shake thy firmness, who have (themselves) no certainty of faith. ",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sura","Ha-Mim ´Ain. Sin. Qaf. Thus doth (He) send inspiration to thee as (He did) to those before thee,- Allah, Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: and He is Most High, Most Great. The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them (by Him Glory): and the angels celebrate the Praises of their Lord, and pray for forgiveness for (all) beings on earth: Behold! Verily Allah is He, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And those who take as protectors others besides Him,- Allah doth watch over them; and thou art not the disposer of their affairs. Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur´an: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her,- and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden, and some in the Blazing Fire. If Allah had so willed, He could have made them a single people; but He admits whom He will to His Mercy; and the Wrong-doers will have no protector nor helper. What! Have they taken (for worship) protectors besides Him? But it is Allah,- He is the Protector, and it is He Who gives life to the dead: It is He Who has power over all things, Whatever it be wherein ye differ, the decision thereof is with Allah: such is Allah my Lord: In Him I trust, and to Him I turn. (He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees (all things). To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges and restricts. The Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things. The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him). And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it. Now then, for that (reason), call (them to the Faith), and stand steadfast as thou art commanded, nor follow thou their vain desires; but say: I believe in the Book which Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: for us (is the responsibility for) our deeds, and for you for your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us together, and to Him is (our) Final Goal. But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted,- futile is their dispute in the Sight of their Lord: on them will be a Penalty terrible. It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth, and the Balance (by which to weigh conduct). And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour is close at hand? Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it: those who believe hold it in awe, and know that it is the Truth. Behold, verily those that dispute concerning the Hour are far astray. Gracious is Allah to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases: and He has power and can carry out His Will. To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter, We give increase in his tilth, and to any that desires the tilth of this world, We grant somewhat thereof, but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter. What! have they partners (in godhead), who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgment, the matter would have been decided between them (at once). But verily the Wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty. Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned, and (the burden of) that must (necessarily) fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: they shall have, before their Lord, all that they wish for. That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty (of Allah). That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin. And if any one earns any good, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (service). What! Do they say, He has forged a falsehood against Allah? But if Allah willed, He could seal up thy heart. And Allah blots out Vanity, and proves the Truth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts. He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins: and He knows all that ye do. And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible Penalty. If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted, Watchful. He is the One that sends down rain (even) after (men) have given up all hope, and scatters His Mercy (far and wide). And He is the Protector, Worthy of all Praise. And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gather them together when He wills. Whatever misfortune happens to you, is because on the things your hands have wrought, and for many (of them) He grants forgiveness. Nor can ye frustrate (aught), (fleeing) through the earth; nor have ye, besides Allah, any one to protect or to help. And among His Signs are the ships, smooth-running through the ocean, (tall) as mountains. If it be His Will He can still the Wind: then would they become motionless on the back of the (ocean). Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful. Or He can cause them to perish because of the (evil) which (the men) have earned; but much doth He forgive. But let those know, who dispute about Our Signs, that there is for them no way of escape. Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) a convenience of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord: Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds, and, when they are angry even then forgive; Those who hearken to their Lord, and establish regular Prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance; And those who, when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them, (are not cowed but) help and defend themselves. The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto (in degree): but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for (Allah) loveth not those who do wrong. But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them, against such there is no cause of blame. The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous. But indeed if any show patience and forgive, that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs. For any whom Allah leaves astray, there is no protector thereafter. And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers, when in sight of the Penalty, Say: Is there any way (to effect) a return? And thou wilt see them brought forward to the (Penalty), in a humble frame of mind because of (their) disgrace, (and) looking with a stealthy glance. And the Believers will say: Those are indeed in loss, who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment. Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty! And no protectors have they to help them, other than Allah. And for any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is no way (to the Goal). Hearken ye to your Lord, before there come a Day which there will be no putting back, because of (the Ordainment of) Allah! that Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial (of your sins)! If then they run away, We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly, when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves, he doth exult thereat, but when some ill happens to him, on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth, truly then is man ungrateful! To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills (and plans). He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan), Or He bestows both males and females, and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power. It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah´s permission, what Allah wills: for He is Most High, Most Wise. And thus have We, by Our Command, sent inspiration to thee: thou knewest not (before) what was Revelation, and what was Faith; but We have made the (Qur´an) a Light, wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thou dost guide (men) to the Straight Way,- The Way of Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. Behold (how) all affairs tend towards Allah! ",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ankebut","A.L.M. Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and that they will not be tested? We did test those before them, and Allah will certainly know those who are true from those who are false. Do those who practise evil think that they will get the better of Us? Evil is their judgment! For those whose hopes are in the meeting with Allah (in the Hereafter, let them strive); for the term (appointed) by Allah is surely coming and He hears and knows (all things). And if any strive (with might and main), they do so for their own souls: for Allah is free of all needs from all creation. Those who believe and work righteous deeds,- from them shall We blot out all evil (that may be) in them, and We shall reward them according to the best of their deeds. We have enjoined on man kindness to parents: but if they (either of them) strive (to force) thee to join with Me (in worship) anything of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not. Ye have (all) to return to me, and I will tell you (the truth) of all that ye did. And those who believe and work righteous deeds,- them shall We admit to the company of the Righteous. Then there are among men such as say, We believe in Allah; but when they suffer affliction in (the cause of) Allah, they treat men´s oppression as if it were the Wrath of Allah! And if help comes (to thee) from thy Lord, they are sure to say, We have (always) been with you! Does not Allah know best all that is in the hearts of all creation? And Allah most certainly knows those who believe, and as certainly those who are Hypocrites. And the Unbelievers say to those who believe: Follow our path, and we will bear (the consequences) of your faults. Never in the least will they bear their faults: in fact they are liars! They will bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens along with their own, and on the Day of Judgments they will be called to account for their falsehoods. We (once) sent Noah to his people, and he tarried among them a thousand years less fifty: but the Deluge overwhelmed them while they (persisted in) sin. But We saved him and the companions of the Ark, and We made the (Ark) a Sign for all peoples! And (We also saved) Abraham: behold, he said to his people, Serve Allah and fear Him: that will be best for you- If ye understand! For ye do worship idols besides Allah, and ye invent falsehood. The things that ye worship besides Allah have no power to give you sustenance: then seek ye sustenance from Allah, serve Him, and be grateful to Him: to Him will be your return. And if ye reject (the Message), so did generations before you: and the duty of the messenger is only to preach publicly (and clearly). See they not how Allah originates creation, then repeats it: truly that is easy for Allah. Say: Travel through the earth and see how Allah did originate creation; so will Allah produce a later creation: for Allah has power over all things. He punishes whom He pleases, and He grants Mercy to whom He pleases, and towards Him are ye turned. Not on earth nor in heaven will ye be able (fleeing) to frustrate (his Plan), nor have ye, besides Allah, any protector or helper. Those who reject the Signs of Allah and the Meeting with Him (in the Hereafter),- it is they who shall despair of My Mercy: it is they who will (suffer) a most grievous Penalty. So naught was the answer of (Abraham´s) people except that they said: Slay him or burn him. But Allah did save him from the Fire. Verily in this are Signs for people who believe. And he said: For you, ye have taken (for worship) idols besides Allah, out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life; but on the Day of Judgment ye shall disown each other and curse each other: and your abode will be the Fire, and ye shall have none to help. But Lut had faith in Him: He said: I will leave home for the sake of my Lord: for He is Exalted in Might, and Wise. And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life; and he was in the Hereafter (of the company) of the Righteous. And (remember) Lut: behold, he said to his people: Ye do commit lewdness, such as no people in Creation (ever) committed before you. Do ye indeed approach men, and cut off the highway?- and practise wickedness (even) in your councils? But his people gave no answer but this: they said: Bring us the Wrath of Allah if thou tellest the truth. He said: O my Lord! help Thou me against people who do mischief! When Our Messengers came to Abraham with the good news, they said: We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township: for truly they are (addicted to) crime. He said: But there is Lut there. They said: Well do we know who is there : we will certainly save him and his following,- except his wife: she is of those who lag behind! And when Our Messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account, and felt himself powerless (to protect) them: but they said: Fear thou not, nor grieve: we are (here) to save thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind. For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a Punishment from heaven, because they have been wickedly rebellious. And We have left thereof an evident Sign, for any people who (care to) understand. To the Madyan (people) (We sent) their brother Shu´aib. Then he said: O my people! serve Allah, and fear the Last Day: nor commit evil on the earth, with intent to do mischief. But they rejected him: Then the mighty Blast seized them, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning. (Remember also) the ´Ad and the Thamud (people): clearly will appear to you from (the traces) of their buildings (their fate): the Evil One made their deeds alluring to them, and kept them back from the Path, though they were gifted with intelligence and skill. (Remember also) Qarun, Pharaoh, and Haman: there came to them Moses with Clear Signs, but they behaved with insolence on the earth; yet they could not overreach (Us). Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed) them: They injured (and oppressed) their own souls. The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of the spider, who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider´s house;- if they but knew. Verily Allah doth know of (every thing) whatever that they call upon besides Him: and He is Exalted (in power), Wise. And such are the Parables We set forth for mankind, but only those understand them who have knowledge. Allah created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): verily in that is a Sign for those who believe. Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing in life) without doubt. And Allah knows the (deeds) that ye do. And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better (than mere disputation), unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam). And thus (it is) that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein, as also do some of these (pagan Arabs): and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. And thou wast not (able) to recite a Book before this (Book came), nor art thou (able) to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case, indeed, would the talkers of vanities have doubted. Nay, here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs. Ye they say: Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord? Say: The signs are indeed with Allah: and I am indeed a clear Warner. And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe. Say: Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and on earth. And it is those who believe in vanities and reject Allah, that will perish (in the end). They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment (for them): had it not been for a term (of respite) appointed, the Punishment would certainly have come to them: and it will certainly reach them,- of a sudden, while they perceive not! They ask thee to hasten on the Punishment: but, of a surety, Hell will encompass the Rejecters of Faith!- On the Day that the Punishment shall cover them from above them and from below them, and (a Voice) shall say: Taste ye (the fruits) of your deeds! O My servants who believe! truly, spacious is My Earth: therefore serve ye Me - (and Me alone)! Every soul shall have a taste of death in the end to Us shall ye be brought back. But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness - to them shall We give a Home in Heaven,- lofty mansions beneath which flow rivers,- to dwell therein for aye;- an excellent reward for those who do (good)!- Those who persevere in patience, and put their trust, in their Lord and Cherisher. How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance? It is Allah who feeds (both) them and you: for He hears and knows (all things). If indeed thou ask them who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law), they will certainly reply, Allah. How are they then deluded away (from the truth)? Allah enlarges the sustenance (which He gives) to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He (similarly) grants by (strict) measure, (as He pleases): for Allah has full knowledge of all things. And if indeed thou ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death, they will certainly reply, Allah! Say, Praise be to Allah! But most of them understand not. What is the life of this world but amusement and play? but verily the Home in the Hereafter,- that is life indeed, if they but knew. Now, if they embark on a boat, they call on Allah, making their devotion sincerely (and exclusively) to Him; but when He has delivered them safely to (dry) land, behold, they give a share (of their worship to others)!- Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts, and giving themselves up to (worldly) enjoyment! But soon will they know. Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then, do they believe in that which is vain, and reject the Grace of Allah? And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects the Truth when it reaches him? Is there not a home in Hell for those who reject Faith? And those who strive in Our (cause),- We will certainly guide them to our Paths: For verily Allah is with those who do right.

"Bakara","A.L.M. This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah; Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them; And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter. They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper. As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe. Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur). Of the people there are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day; but they do not (really) believe. Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and realise (it) not! In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves). When it is said to them: Make not mischief on the earth, they say: Why, we only Want to make peace! Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise (it) not. When it is said to them: Believe as the others believe: They say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know. When they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: We are really with you: We (were) only jesting. Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro). These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction, Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see. Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path). Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith! The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things. O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness; Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth). And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true. But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith. But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: Why, this is what we were fed with before, for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever). Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: What means Allah by this similitude? By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),- Those who break Allah´s Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder what Allah Has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss (only) to themselves. How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return. It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge. Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: I will create a vicegerent on earth. They said: Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)? He said: I know what ye know not. And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: Tell me the names of these if ye are right. They said: Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom. He said: O Adam! Tell them their names. When he had told them, Allah said: Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal? And behold, We said to the angels: Bow down to Adam and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith. We said: O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression. Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time. Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. We said: Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from me, whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein. O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you, and fear none but Me. And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone. And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what it is). And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship). Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (To practise it) yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand? Nay, seek (Allah´s) help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is indeed hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit,- Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and that they are to return to Him. Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all other (for My Message). Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another nor shall intercession be accepted for her, nor shall compensation be taken from her, nor shall anyone be helped (from outside). And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord. And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh´s people within your very sight. And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong. Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful. And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (Between right and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright. And remember Moses said to his people: O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker. Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. And remember ye said: O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly, but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye looked on. Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful. And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails, saying: Eat of the good things We have provided for you: (But they rebelled); to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls. And remember We said: Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words, and We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good. But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed (Our command) repeatedly. And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: Strike the rock with thy staff. Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth. And remember ye said: O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions. He said: Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want! They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing. Those who believe (in the Qur´an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (The towering height) of Mount (Sinai) : (Saying): Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein: Perchance ye may fear Allah. But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah to you, ye had surely been among the lost. And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: Be ye apes, despised and rejected. So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a lesson to those who fear Allah. And remember Moses said to his people: Allah commands that ye sacrifice a heifer. They said: Makest thou a laughing-stock of us? He said: Allah save me from being an ignorant (fool)! They said: Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is! He said; He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded! They said: Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour. He said: He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration of beholders! They said: Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah wills. He said: He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish. They said: Now hast thou brought the truth. Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will. Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide. So We said: Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer). Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understand. Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do. Can ye (o ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe in you?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and perverted it knowingly after they understood it. Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: We believe: But when they meet each other in private, they say: Shall you tell them what Allah hath revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord?- Do ye not understand (their aim)? Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal? And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture. Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:This is from Allah, to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby. And they say: The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days: Say: Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise? or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know? Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever). But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever). And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practise regular charity. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now). And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly ratified, and to this ye can bear witness. After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do. These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay! They say, Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah´s Word: we need no more). Nay, Allah´s curse is on them for their blasphemy: Little is it they believe. And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognised, they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith. Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy that Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith. When it is said to them, Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, they say, We believe in what was sent down to us: yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: Why then have ye slain the prophets of Allah in times gone by, if ye did indeed believe? There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (Even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully. And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law): They said: We hear, and we disobey: And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith! Say: If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere. But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their hands have sent on before them. and Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers. Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even more than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due) punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do. Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the (revelation) to thy heart by Allah´s will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings for those who believe,- Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and Michael,- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith. We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat); and none reject them but those who are perverse. Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside?- Nay, Most of them are faithless. And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what was with them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if (it had been something) they did not know! They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme. They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah´s permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew! If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew! O ye of Faith! Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but words of respect; and hearken (to him): To those without Faith is a grievous punishment. It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book, nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is Lord of grace abounding. None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things? Knowest thou not that to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper. Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? but whoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief, Hath strayed without doubt from the even way. Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy, after the Truth hath become Manifest unto them: But forgive and overlook, Till Allah accomplish His purpose; for Allah Hath power over all things. And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah: for Allah sees Well all that ye do. And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. Those are their (vain) desires. Say: Produce your proof if ye are truthful. Nay,-whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,- He will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. The Jews say: The Christians have naught (to stand) upon; and the Christians say: The Jews have naught (To stand) upon. Yet they (Profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment. And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of Allah, Allah´s name should be celebrated?-whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come, an exceeding torment. To Allah belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there is the presence of Allah. For Allah is all-Pervading, all-Knowing. They say: Allah hath begotten a son :Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him. To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When He decreeth a matter, He saith to it: Be, and it is. Say those without knowledge: Why speaketh not Allah unto us? or why cometh not unto us a Sign? So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the Signs unto any people who hold firmly to Faith (in their hearts). Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner: But of thee no question shall be asked of the Companions of the Blazing Fire. Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: The Guidance of Allah,-that is the (only) Guidance. Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against Allah. Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied: They are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith therein,- the loss is their own. O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others (for My Message). Then guard yourselves against a-Day when one soul shall not avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall intercession profit her nor shall anyone be helped (from outside). And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: I will make thee an Imam to the Nations. He pleaded: And also (Imams) from my offspring! He answered: But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers. Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We covenanted with Abraham and Isma´il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer). And remember Abraham said: My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and feed its people with fruits,-such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day. He said: (Yea), and such as reject Faith,-for a while will I grant them their pleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment of Fire,- an evil destination (indeed)! And remember Abraham and Isma´il raised the foundations of the House (With this prayer): Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-knowing. Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will), and of our progeny a people Muslim, bowing to Thy (will); and show us our place for the celebration of (due) rites; and turn unto us (in Mercy); for Thou art the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them: For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise. And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase their souls with folly? Him We chose and rendered pure in this world: And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous. Behold! his Lord said to him: Bow (thy will to Me): He said: I bow (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe. And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam. Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to his sons: What will ye worship after me? They said: We shall worship Thy god and the god of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma´il and Isaac,- the one (True) Allah: To Him we bow (in Islam). That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case! They say: Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (To salvation). Say thou: Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with Allah. Say ye: We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma´il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam). So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn back, it is they who are in schism; but Allah will suffice thee as against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. (Our religion is) the Baptism of Allah: And who can baptize better than Allah? And it is He Whom we worship. Say: Will ye dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that We are sincere (in our faith) in Him? Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma´il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from Allah? but Allah is not unmindful of what ye do! That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case: The fools among the people will say: What hath turned them from the Qibla to which they were used? Say: To Allah belong both east and West: He guideth whom He will to a Way that is straight. Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And never would Allah Make your faith of no effect. For Allah is to all people Most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful. We see the turning of thy face (for guidance to the heavens: now Shall We turn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor is Allah unmindful of what they do. Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs (together), they would not follow Thy Qibla; nor art thou going to follow their Qibla; nor indeed will they follow each other´s Qibla. If thou after the knowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their (vain) desires,-then wert thou Indeed (clearly) in the wrong. The people of the Book know this as they know their own sons; but some of them conceal the truth which they themselves know. The Truth is from thy Lord; so be not at all in doubt. To each is a goal to which Allah turns him; then strive together (as in a race) Towards all that is good. Wheresoever ye are, Allah will bring you Together. For Allah Hath power over all things. From whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque; that is indeed the truth from the Lord. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do. So from whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction of the sacred Mosque; and wheresoever ye are, Turn your face thither: that there be no ground of dispute against you among the people, except those of them that are bent on wickedness; so fear them not, but fear Me; and that I may complete My favours on you, and ye May (consent to) be guided; A similar (favour have ye already received) in that We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and sanctifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new knowledge. Then do ye remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and reject not Faith. O ye who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for Allah is with those who patiently persevere. And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah: They are dead. Nay, they are living, though ye perceive (it) not. Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits (of your toil), but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere, Who say, when afflicted with calamity: To Allah We belong, and to Him is our return:- They are those on whom (Descend) blessings from Allah, and Mercy, and they are the ones that receive guidance. Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times, should compass them round, it is no sin in them. And if any one obeyeth his own impulse to good,- be sure that Allah is He Who recogniseth and knoweth. Those who conceal the clear (Signs) We have sent down, and the Guidance, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book,-on them shall be Allah´s curse, and the curse of those entitled to curse,- Except those who repent and make amends and openly declare (the Truth): To them I turn; for I am Oft-returning, Most Merciful. Those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- on them is Allah´s curse, and the curse of angels, and of all mankind; They will abide therein: Their penalty will not be lightened, nor will respite be their (lot). And your Allah is One Allah: There is no god but He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of the night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of mankind; in the rain which Allah Sends down from the skies, and the life which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead; in the beasts of all kinds that He scatters through the earth; in the change of the winds, and the clouds which they Trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth;- (Here) indeed are Signs for a people that are wise. Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides Allah, as equal (with Allah): They love them as they should love Allah. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for Allah. If only the unrighteous could see, behold, they would see the penalty: that to Allah belongs all power, and Allah will strongly enforce the penalty. Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who follow (them) : They would see the penalty, and all relations between them would be cut off. And those who followed would say: If only We had one more chance, We would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us. Thus will Allah show them (The fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but) regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire. O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, Lawful and good; and do not follow the footsteps of the evil one, for he is to you an avowed enemy. For he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say of Allah that of which ye have no knowledge. When it is said to them: Follow what Allah hath revealed: They say: Nay! we shall follow the ways of our fathers. What! even though their fathers Were void of wisdom and guidance? The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout Like a goat-herd, to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries: Deaf, dumb, and blind, they are void of wisdom. O ye who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah, if it is Him ye worship. He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless. For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful. Those who conceal Allah´s revelations in the Book, and purchase for them a miserable profit,- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire; Allah will not address them on the Day of Resurrection. Nor purify them: Grievous will be their penalty. They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in place of Forgiveness. Ah! what boldness (They show) for the Fire! (Their doom is) because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far (from the purpose). It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the Allah-fearing. O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty. In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) Life to you, o ye men of understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves. It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the Allah-fearing. If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For Allah hears and knows (All things). But if anyone fears partiality or wrong-doing on the part of the testator, and makes peace between (The parties concerned), there is no wrong in him: For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint,- (Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (Should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (With hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew. Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur´an, as a guide to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period (Should be made up) by days later. Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful. When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them): I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let them also, with a will, Listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they may walk in the right way. Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what Allah Hath ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast Till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are Limits (set by) Allah: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to men: that they may learn self-restraint. And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people´s property. They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage. It is no virtue if ye enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if ye fear Allah. Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear Allah: That ye may prosper. Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors. And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have Turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith. But if they cease, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. And fight them on until there is no more Tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression. The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all things prohibited,- there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves. And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction; but do good; for Allah loveth those who do good. And complete the Hajj or ´umra in the service of Allah. But if ye are prevented (From completing it), send an offering for sacrifice, such as ye may find, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp, (Necessitating shaving), (He should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice; and when ye are in peaceful conditions (again), if any one wishes to continue the ´umra on to the hajj, He must make an offering, such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, He should fast three days during the hajj and seven days on his return, Making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah Is strict in punishment. For Hajj are the months well known. If any one undertakes that duty therein, Let there be no obscenity, nor wickedness, nor wrangling in the Hajj. And whatever good ye do, (be sure) Allah knoweth it. And take a provision (With you) for the journey, but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, o ye that are wise. It is no crime in you if ye seek of the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage). Then when ye pour down from (Mount) Arafat, celebrate the praises of Allah at the Sacred Monument, and celebrate His praises as He has directed you, even though, before this, ye went astray. Then pass on at a quick pace from the place whence it is usual for the multitude so to do, and ask for Allah´s forgiveness. For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. So when ye have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises of Allah, as ye used to celebrate the praises of your fathers,- yea, with far more Heart and soul. There are men who say: Our Lord! Give us (Thy bounties) in this world! but they will have no portion in the Hereafter. And there are men who say: Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire! To these will be allotted what they have earned; and Allah is quick in account. Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days. But if any one hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if any one stays on, there is no blame on him, if his aim is to do right. Then fear Allah, and know that ye will surely be gathered unto Him. There is the type of man whose speech about this world´s life May dazzle thee, and he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart; yet is he the most contentious of enemies. When he turns his back, His aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. But Allah loveth not mischief. When it is said to him, Fear Allah, He is led by arrogance to (more) crime. Enough for him is Hell;-An evil bed indeed (To lie on)! And there is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of Allah: And Allah is full of kindness to (His) devotees. O ye who believe! Enter into Islam whole-heartedly; and follow not the footsteps of the evil one; for he is to you an avowed enemy. If ye backslide after the clear (Signs) have come to you, then know that Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. Will they wait until Allah comes to them in canopies of clouds, with angels (in His train) and the question is (thus) settled? but to Allah do all questions go back (for decision). Ask the Children of Israel how many clear (Signs) We have sent them. But if any one, after Allah´s favour has come to him, substitutes (something else), Allah is strict in punishment. The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and they scoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection; for Allah bestows His abundance without measure on whom He will. Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad tidings and warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people in matters wherein they differed; but the People of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among themselves, except through selfish contumacy. Allah by His Grace Guided the believers to the Truth, concerning that wherein they differed. For Allah guided whom He will to a path that is straight. Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden (of bliss) without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: When (will come) the help of Allah? Ah! Verily, the help of Allah is (always) near! They ask thee what they should spend (In charity). Say: Whatever ye spend that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in want and for wayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good, -Allah knoweth it well. Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not. They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: Fighting therein is a grave (offence); but graver is it in the sight of Allah to prevent access to the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and drive out its members. Tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die in unbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; they will be companions of the Fire and will abide therein. Those who believed and those who suffered exile and fought (and strove and struggled) in the path of Allah,- they have the hope of the Mercy of Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. They ask thee concerning wine and gambling. Say: In them is great sin, and some profit, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit. They ask thee how much they are to spend; Say: What is beyond your needs. Thus doth Allah Make clear to you His Signs: In order that ye may consider- (Their bearings) on this life and the Hereafter. They ask thee concerning orphans. Say: The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix their affairs with yours, they are your brethren; but Allah knows the man who means mischief from the man who means good. And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties: He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise. Do not marry unbelieving women (idolaters), until they believe: A slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she allures you. Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe: A man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he allures you. Unbelievers do (but) beckon you to the Fire. But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of bliss) and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: That they may celebrate His praise. They ask thee concerning women´s courses. Say: They are a hurt and a pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, ye may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by Allah. For Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean. Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will; but do some good act for your souls beforehand; and fear Allah. And know that ye are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give (these) good tidings to those who believe. And make not Allah´s (name) an excuse in your oaths against doing good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons; for Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth all things. Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing. For those who take an oath for abstention from their wives, a waiting for four months is ordained; if then they return, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. But if their intention is firm for divorce, Allah heareth and knoweth all things. Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold Together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah, there is no blame on either of them if she give something for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah; so do not transgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by Allah, such persons wrong (Themselves as well as others). So if a husband divorces his wife (irrevocably), He cannot, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. Such are the limits ordained by Allah, which He makes plain to those who understand. When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their (´Iddat), either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but do not take them back to injure them, (or) to take undue advantage; if any one does that; He wrongs his own soul. Do not treat Allah´s Signs as a jest, but solemnly rehearse Allah´s favours on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Book and Wisdom, for your instruction. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is well acquainted with all things. When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their (´Iddat), do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on equitable terms. This instruction is for all amongst you, who believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is (the course Making for) most virtue and purity amongst you and Allah knows, and ye know not. The mothers shall give such to their offspring for two whole years, if the father desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be Treated unfairly on account of her child. Nor father on account of his child, an heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If ye decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided ye pay (the mother) what ye offered, on equitable terms. But fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what ye do. If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do. There is no blame on you if ye make an offer of betrothal or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that ye cherish them in your hearts: But do not make a secret contract with them except in terms Honourable, nor resolve on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that Allah Knoweth what is in your hearts, and take heed of Him; and know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing. There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (A suitable gift), the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means;- A gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing. And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man´s half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man´s half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget Liberality between yourselves. For Allah sees well all that ye do. Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer; and stand before Allah in a devout (frame of mind). If ye fear (an enemy), pray on foot, or riding, (as may be most convenient), but when ye are in security, celebrate Allah´s praises in the manner He has taught you, which ye knew not (before). Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year´s maintenance and residence; but if they leave (The residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. For divorced women Maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable (scale). This is a duty on the righteous. Thus doth Allah Make clear His Signs to you: In order that ye may understand. Didst thou not Turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, though they were thousands (In number), for fear of death? Allah said to them: Die: Then He restored them to life. For Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but Most of them are ungrateful. Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things. Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that giveth (you) Want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return. Hast thou not Turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? they said to a prophet (That was) among them: Appoint for us a king, that we May fight in the cause of Allah. He said: Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that that ye will not fight? They said: How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families? but when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But Allah Has full knowledge of those who do wrong. Their Prophet said to them: Allah hath appointed Talut as king over you. They said: How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted, with wealth in abundance? He said: Allah hath Chosen him above you, and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and bodily prowess: Allah Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things. And (further) their Prophet said to them: A Sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if ye indeed have faith. When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: Allah will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army: Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused. but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said: This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces. but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: How oft, by Allah´s will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere. When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed: Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm: Help us against those that reject faith. By Allah´s will they routed them; and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him power and wisdom and taught him whatever (else) He willed. And did not Allah Check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief: But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds. These are the Signs of Allah: we rehearse them to thee in truth: verily Thou art one of the messengers. Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the holy spirit. If Allah had so willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other, after clear (Signs) had come to them, but they (chose) to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah Fulfilleth His plan. O ye who believe! Spend out of (the bounties) We have provided for you, before the Day comes when no bargaining (Will avail), nor friendship nor intercession. Those who reject Faith they are the wrong-doers. Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory). Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein (For ever). Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death. He said: I give life and death. Said Abraham: But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West. Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust. Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after (this) its death? but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: How long didst thou tarry (thus)? He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day. He said: Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh. When this was shown clearly to him, he said: I know that Allah hath power over all things. When Abraham said: Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead,  He replied: Have you no faith? He said Yes, but just to reassure my heart. Allah said, Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of Allah is that of a grain of corn: it groweth seven ears, and each ear Hath a hundred grains. Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things. Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah, and follow not up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury,-for them their reward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed by injury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing. O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men, but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it (Just) a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with aught they have earned. And Allah guideth not those who reject faith. And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to please Allah and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest, and if it receives not Heavy rain, light moisture sufficeth it. Allah seeth well whatever ye do. Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vines and streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are not strong (enough to look after themselves)- that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with fire therein, and be burnt up? Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His) Signs; that ye may consider. O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye may give away something, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise. The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly. Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties. And Allah careth for all and He knoweth all things. He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing; but none will grasp the Message but men of understanding. And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion, be sure Allah knows it all. But the wrong-doers have no helpers. If ye disclose (acts of) charity, even so it is well, but if ye conceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do. It is not required of thee (O Messenger), to set them on the right path, but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking the Face of Allah. Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you, and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly. (Charity is) for those in need, who, in Allah´s cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land, seeking (For trade or work): the ignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured Allah knoweth it well. Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: Trade is like usury, but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever). Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked. Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and give up what remains of your demand for usury, if ye are indeed believers. If ye do it not, Take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger: But if ye turn back, ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly. If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time Till it is easy for him to repay. But if ye remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if ye only knew. And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly. O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuse to write: as Allah Has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear His Lord Allah, and not diminish aught of what he owes. If they party liable is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable Himself to dictate, Let his guardian dictate faithfully, and get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (For evidence). Disdain not to reduce to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of Allah, More suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witness whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah; For it is Good that teaches you. And Allah is well acquainted with all things. If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust, and let him Fear his Lord conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it, - his heart is tainted with sin. And Allah knoweth all that ye do. If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, Let the trustee (Faithfully) discharge His trust, and let him fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it,- His heart is tainted with sin. And Allah Knoweth all that ye do. To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it, Allah Calleth you to account for it. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and punisheth whom He pleaseth, for Allah hath power over all things. The Messenger believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the men of faith. Each one (of them) believeth in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers. We make no distinction (they say) between one and another of His messengers. And they say: We hear, and we obey: (We seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys. On no soul doth Allah Place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns. (Pray:) Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden Like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; Help us against those who stand against faith.

"Yunus","A.L.R. These are the ayats of the Book of Wisdom. Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves?- that he should warn mankind (of their danger), and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. (But) say the Unbelievers: This is indeed an evident sorcerer! Verily your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne (of authority), regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition? To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation, and repeateth it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids, and a penalty grievous, because they did reject Him. It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty), and measured out stages for her; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail, for those who understand. Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day, and in all that Allah hath created, in the heavens and the earth, are signs for those who fear Him. Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present, and those who heed not Our Signs,- Their abode is the Fire, because of the (evil) they earned. Those who believe, and work righteousness,- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss. (This will be) their cry therein: Glory to Thee, O Allah! And Peace will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds! If Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good,- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering in distraction to and fro. When trouble toucheth a man, He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side, or sitting, or standing. But when We have solved his trouble, he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes! Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin! Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how ye would behave! But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, Say: Bring us a reading other than this, or change this, Say: It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come). Say: If Allah had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand? Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah, or deny His Signs? But never will prosper those who sin. They serve, besides Allah, things that hurt them not nor profit them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah. Say: Do ye indeed inform Allah of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth?- Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)! Mankind was but one nation, but differed (later). Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord, their differences would have been settled between them. They say: Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord? Say: The Unseen is only for Allah (to know), then wait ye: I too will wait with you. When We make mankind taste of some mercy after adversity hath touched them, behold! they take to plotting against Our Signs! Say: Swifter to plan is Allah! Verily, Our messengers record all the plots that ye make! He it is Who enableth you to traverse through land and sea; so that ye even board ships;- they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they rejoice thereat; then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed: they cry unto Allah, sincerely offering (their) duty unto Him saying, If thou dost deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude! But when he delivereth them, behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right! O mankind! your insolence is against your own souls,- an enjoyment of the life of the present: in the end, to Us is your return, and We shall show you the truth of all that ye did. The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect. But Allah doth call to the Home of Peace: He doth guide whom He pleaseth to a way that is straight. To those who do right is a goodly (reward)- Yea, more (than in measure)! No darkness nor shame shall cover their faces! they are companions of the garden; they will abide therein (for aye)! But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil: ignominy will cover their (faces): No defender will they have from (the wrath of) Allah: Their faces will be covered, as it were, with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night: they are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein (for aye)! One day shall We gather them all together. Then shall We say to those who joined gods (with Us): To your place! ye and those ye joined as ´partners´ We shall separate them, and their Partners shall say: It was not us that ye worshipped! Enough is Allah for a witness between us and you: we certainly knew nothing of your worship of us! There will every soul prove (the fruits of) the deeds it sent before: they will be brought back to Allah their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch. Say: Who is it that sustains you (in life) from the sky and from the earth? or who is it that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? and who is it that rules and regulates all affairs? They will soon say, Allah. Say, will ye not then show piety (to Him)? Such is Allah, your real Cherisher and Sustainer: apart from truth, what (remains) but error? How then are ye turned away? Thus is the word of thy Lord proved true against those who rebel: Verily they will not believe. Say: Of your ´partners´, can any originate creation and repeat it? Say: It is Allah Who originates creation and repeats it: then how are ye deluded away (from the truth)? Say: Of your ´partners´ is there any that can give any guidance towards truth? Say: It is Allah Who gives guidance towards truth, is then He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance (himself) unless he is guided? what then is the matter with you? How judge ye? But most of them follow nothing but fancy: truly fancy can be of no avail against truth. Verily Allah is well aware of all that they do. This Qur´an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds. Or do they say, He forged it? say: Bring then a Sura like unto it, and call (to your aid) anyone you can besides Allah, if it be ye speak the truth! Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong! Of them there are some who believe therein, and some who do not: and thy Lord knoweth best those who are out for mischief. If they charge thee with falsehood, say: My work to me, and yours to you! ye are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what ye do! Among them are some who (pretend to) listen to thee: But canst thou make the deaf to hear,- even though they are without understanding? And among them are some who look at thee: but canst thou guide the blind,- even though they will not see? Verily Allah will not deal unjustly with man in aught: It is man that wrongs his own soul. One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance. Whether We show thee (realised in thy life-time) some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul (to Our Mercy) (Before that),- in any case, to Us is their return: ultimately Allah is witness, to all that they do. To every people (was sent) a messenger: when their messenger comes (before them), the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged. They say: When will this promise come to pass,- if ye speak the truth? Say: I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except as Allah willeth. To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can they advance (it in anticipation). Say: Do ye see,- if His punishment should come to you by night or by day,- what portion of it would the sinners wish to hasten? Would ye then believe in it at last, when it actually cometh to pass? (It will then be said): ´Ah! now? and ye wanted (aforetime) to hasten it on!´ At length will be said to the wrong-doers: ´Taste ye the enduring punishment! ye get but the recompense of what ye earned!´ They seek to be informed by thee: Is that true? Say: Aye! by my Lord! it is the very truth! and ye cannot frustrate it! Every soul that hath sinned, if it possessed all that is on earth, would fain give it in ransom: They would declare (their) repentance when they see the penalty: but the judgment between them will be with justice, and no wrong will be done unto them. Is it not (the case) that to Allah belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth? Is it not (the case) that Allah´s promise is assuredly true? Yet most of them understand not. It is He Who giveth life and who taketh it, and to Him shall ye all be brought back. O mankind! there hath come to you a direction from your Lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a guidance and a Mercy. Say: In the bounty of Allah. And in His Mercy,- in that let them rejoice: that is better than the (wealth) they hoard. Say: See ye what things Allah hath sent down to you for sustenance? Yet ye hold forbidden some things thereof and (some things) lawful. Say: Hath Allah indeed permitted you, or do ye invent (things) to attribute to Allah? And what think those who invent lies against Allah, of the Day of Judgment? Verily Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful. In whatever business thou mayest be, and whatever portion thou mayest be reciting from the Qur´an,- and whatever deed ye (mankind) may be doing,- We are witnesses thereof when ye are deeply engrossed therein. Nor is hidden from thy Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. And not the least and not the greatest of these things but are recorded in a clear record. Behold! verily on the friends of Allah there is no fear, nor shall they grieve; Those who believe and (constantly) guard against evil;- For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present and in the Hereafter; no change can there be in the words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme felicity. Let not their speech grieve thee: for all power and honour belong to Allah: It is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things). Behold! verily to Allah belong all creatures, in the heavens and on earth. What do they follow who worship as His partners other than Allah? They follow nothing but fancy, and they do nothing but lie. He it is That hath made you the night that ye may rest therein, and the day to make things visible (to you). Verily in this are signs for those who listen (to His Message). They say: Allah hath begotten a son! - Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! His are all things in the heavens and on earth! No warrant have ye for this! say ye about Allah what ye know not? Say: Those who invent a lie against Allah will never prosper. A little enjoyment in this world!- and then, to Us will be their return, then shall We make them taste the severest penalty for their blasphemies. Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold! he said to his people: O my people, if it be hard on your (mind) that I should stay (with you) and commemorate the signs of Allah,- yet I put my trust in Allah. Get ye then an agreement about your plan and among your partners, so your plan be on to you dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite. But if ye turn back, (consider): no reward have I asked of you: my reward is only due from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to Allah´s will (in Islam). They rejected Him, but We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them inherit (the earth), while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our Signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not)! Then after him We sent (many) messengers to their peoples: they brought them Clear Signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors. Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they were arrogant: they were a people in sin. When the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: This is indeed evident sorcery! Said Moses: Say ye (this) about the truth when it hath (actually) reached you? Is sorcery (like) this? But sorcerers will not prosper. They said: Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following,- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land? But not we shall believe in you! Said Pharaoh: Bring me every sorcerer well versed. When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: Throw ye what ye (wish) to throw! When they had had their throw, Moses said: What ye have brought is sorcery: Allah will surely make it of no effect: for Allah prospereth not the work of those who make mischief. And Allah by His words doth prove and establish His truth, however much the sinners may hate it! But none believed in Moses except some children of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharaoh was mighty on the earth and one who transgressed all bounds. Moses said: O my people! If ye do (really) believe in Allah, then in Him put your trust if ye submit (your will to His). They said: In Allah do we put out trust. Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who practise oppression; And deliver us by Thy Mercy from those who reject (Thee). We inspired Moses and his brother with this Message: Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, make your dwellings into places of worship, and establish regular prayers: and give glad tidings to those who believe! Moses prayed: Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of the present, and so, Our Lord, they mislead (men) from Thy Path. Deface, our Lord, the features of their wealth, and send hardness to their hearts, so they will not believe until they see the grievous penalty. Allah said: Accepted is your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)! So stand ye straight, and follow not the path of those who know not. We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when overwhelmed with the flood, he said: I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in: I am of those who submit (to Allah in Islam). (It was said to him): Ah now!- But a little while before, wast thou in rebellion!- and thou didst mischief (and violence)! This day shall We save thee in the body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs! We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place, and provided for them sustenance of the best: it was after knowledge had been granted to them, that they fell into schisms. Verily Allah will judge between them as to the schisms amongst them, on the Day of Judgment. If thou wert in doubt as to what We have revealed unto thee, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before thee: the Truth hath indeed come to thee from thy Lord: so be in no wise of those in doubt. Nor be of those who reject the signs of Allah, or thou shalt be of those who perish. Those against whom the word of thy Lord hath been verified would not believe- Even if every Sign was brought unto them,- until they see (for themselves) the penalty grievous. Why was there not a single township (among those We warned), which believed,- so its faith should have profited it,- except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the penalty of ignominy in the life of the present, and permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while. If it had been thy Lord´s will, they would all have believed,- all who are on earth! wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe! No soul can believe, except by the will of Allah, and He will place doubt (or obscurity) on those who will not understand. Say: Behold all that is in the heavens and on earth; but neither Signs nor Warners profit those who believe not. Do they then expect (any thing) but (what happened in) the days of the men who passed away before them? Say: Wait ye then: for I, too, will wait with you. In the end We deliver Our messengers and those who believe: Thus is it fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe! Say: O ye men! If ye are in doubt as to my religion, (behold!) I worship not what ye worship, other than Allah! But I worship Allah - Who will take your souls (at death): I am commanded to be (in the ranks) of the Believers, And further (thus): ´set thy face towards religion with true piety, and never in any wise be of the Unbelievers; ´Nor call on any, other than Allah;- Such will neither profit thee nor hurt thee: if thou dost, behold! thou shalt certainly be of those who do wrong.´ If Allah do touch thee with hurt, there is none can remove it but He: if He do design some benefit for thee, there is none can keep back His favour: He causeth it to reach whomsoever of His servants He pleaseth. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: O ye men! Now Truth hath reached you from your Lord! those who receive guidance, do so for the good of their own souls; those who stray, do so to their own loss: and I am not (set) over you to arrange your affairs. Follow thou the inspiration sent unto thee, and be patient and constant, till Allah do decide: for He is the best to decide. ",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Taha","Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Qur´an to thee to be (an occasion) for thy distress, But only as an admonition to those who fear (Allah),- A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the heavens on high. (Allah) Most Gracious is firmly established on the throne (of authority). To Him belongs what is in the heavens and on earth, and all between them, and all beneath the soil. If thou pronounce the word aloud, (it is no matter): for verily He knoweth what is secret and what is yet more hidden. Allah! there is no god but He! To Him belong the most Beautiful Names. Has the story of Moses reached thee? Behold, he saw a fire: So he said to his family, Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find some guidance at the fire. But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard: O Moses! Verily I am thy Lord! therefore (in My presence) put off thy shoes: thou art in the sacred valley Tuwa. I have chosen thee: listen, then, to the inspiration (sent to thee). Verily, I am Allah: There is no god but I: So serve thou Me (only), and establish regular prayer for celebrating My praise. Verily the Hour is coming - My design is to keep it hidden - for every soul to receive its reward by the measure of its Endeavour. Therefore let not such as believe not therein but follow their own lusts, divert thee therefrom, lest thou perish!.. And what is that in the right hand, O Moses? He said, It is my rod: on it I lean; with it I beat down fodder for my flocks; and in it I find other uses. (Allah) said, Throw it, O Moses! He threw it, and behold! It was a snake, active in motion. (Allah) said, Seize it, and fear not: We shall return it at once to its former condition.. Now draw thy hand close to thy side: It shall come forth white (and shining), without harm (or stain),- as another Sign,- In order that We may show thee (two) of our Greater Signs. Go thou to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds. (Moses) said: O my Lord! expand me my breast; Ease my task for me; And remove the impediment from my speech, So they may understand what I say: And give me a Minister from my family, Aaron, my brother; Add to my strength through him, And make him share my task: That we may celebrate Thy praise without stint, And remember Thee without stint: For Thou art He that (ever) regardeth us. (Allah) said: Granted is thy prayer, O Moses! And indeed We conferred a favour on thee another time (before). Behold! We sent to thy mother, by inspiration, the message: ´Throw (the child) into the chest, and throw (the chest) into the river: the river will cast him up on the bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him´: But I cast (the garment of) love over thee from Me: and (this) in order that thou mayest be reared under Mine eye. Behold! thy sister goeth forth and saith, ´shall I show you one who will nurse and rear the (child)?´ So We brought thee back to thy mother, that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve. Then thou didst slay a man, but We saved thee from trouble, and We tried thee in various ways. Then didst thou tarry a number of years with the people of Midian. Then didst thou come hither as ordained, O Moses! And I have prepared thee for Myself (for service).. Go, thou and thy brother, with My Signs, and slacken not, either of you, in keeping Me in remembrance. Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds; But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear (Allah). They (Moses and Aaron) said: Our Lord! We fear lest he hasten with insolence against us, or lest he transgress all bounds. He said: Fear not: for I am with you: I hear and see (everything). So go ye both to him, and say, ´Verily we are messengers sent by thy Lord: Send forth, therefore, the Children of Israel with us, and afflict them not: with a Sign, indeed, have we come from thy Lord! and peace to all who follow guidance! ´Verily it has been revealed to us that the Penalty (awaits) those who reject and turn away.´ (When this message was delivered), (Pharaoh) said: Who, then, O Moses, is the Lord of you two? He said: Our Lord is He Who gave to each (created) thing its form and nature, and further, gave (it) guidance. (Pharaoh) said: What then is the condition of previous generations? He replied: The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded: my Lord never errs, nor forgets,- He Who has, made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled you to go about therein by roads (and channels); and has sent down water from the sky. With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate from the others. Eat (for yourselves) and pasture your cattle: verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding. From the (earth) did We create you, and into it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you out once again. And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs, but he did reject and refuse. He said: Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, O Moses? But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between us and thee, which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in a place where both shall have even chances. Moses said: Your tryst is the Day of the Festival, and let the people be assembled when the sun is well up. So Pharaoh withdrew: He concerted his plan, and then came (back). Moses said to him: Woe to you! Forge not ye a lie against Allah, lest He destroy you (at once) utterly by chastisement: the forger must suffer frustration! So they disputed, one with another, over their affair, but they kept their talk secret. They said: These two are certainly (expert) magicians: their object is to drive you out from your land with their magic, and to do away with your most cherished institutions. Therefore concert your plan, and then assemble in (serried) ranks: He wins (all along) today who gains the upper hand. They said: O Moses! whether wilt thou that thou throw (first) or that we be the first to throw? He said, Nay, throw ye first! Then behold their ropes and their rods-so it seemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion! So Moses conceived in his mind a (sort of) fear. We said: Fear not! for thou hast indeed the upper hand: Throw that which is in thy right hand: Quickly will it swallow up that which they have faked what they have faked is but a magician´s trick: and the magician thrives not, (no matter) where he goes. So the magicians were thrown down to prostration: they said, We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses. (Pharaoh) said: Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this must be your leader, who has taught you magic! be sure I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm-trees: so shall ye know for certain, which of us can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment! They said: Never shall we regard thee as more than the Clear Signs that have come to us, or than Him Who created us! so decree whatever thou desirest to decree: for thou canst only decree (touching) the life of this world. For us, we have believed in our Lord: may He forgive us our faults, and the magic to which thou didst compel us: for Allah is Best and Most Abiding. Verily he who comes to his Lord as a sinner (at Judgment),- for him is Hell: therein shall he neither die nor live. But such as come to Him as Believers who have worked righteous deeds,- for them are ranks exalted,- Gardens of Eternity, beneath which flow rivers: they will dwell therein for aye: such is the reward of those who purify themselves (from evil). We sent an inspiration to Moses: Travel by night with My servants, and strike a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken (by Pharaoh) and without (any other) fear. Then Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the waters completely overwhelmed them and covered them up. Pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright. O ye Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a Covenant with you on the right side of Mount (Sinai), and We sent down to you Manna and quails: (Saying): Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance, but commit no excess therein, lest My Wrath should justly descend on you: and those on whom descends My Wrath do perish indeed! But, without doubt, I am (also) He that forgives again and again, to those who repent, believe, and do right, who,- in fine, are ready to receive true guidance. (When Moses was up on the Mount, Allah said:) What made thee hasten in advance of thy people, O Moses? He replied: Behold, they are close on my footsteps: I hastened to thee, O my Lord, to please thee. (Allah) said: We have tested thy people in thy absence: the Samiri has led them astray. So Moses returned to his people in a state of indignation and sorrow. He said: O my people! did not your Lord make a handsome promise to you? Did then the promise seem to you long (in coming)? Or did ye desire that Wrath should descend from your Lord on you, and so ye broke your promise to me? They said: We broke not the promise to thee, as far as lay in our power: but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the (whole) people, and we threw them (into the fire), and that was what the Samiri suggested. Then he brought out (of the fire) before the (people) the image of a calf: It seemed to low: so they said: This is your god, and the god of Moses, but (Moses) has forgotten! Could they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good? Aaron had already, before this said to them: O my people! ye are being tested in this: for verily your Lord is (Allah) Most Gracious; so follow me and obey my command. They had said: We will not abandon this cult, but we will devote ourselves to it until Moses returns to us. (Moses) said: O Aaron! what kept thee back, when thou sawest them going wrong, From following me? Didst thou then disobey my order? (Aaron) replied: O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard nor by (the hair of) my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say, ´Thou has caused a division among the children of Israel, and thou didst not respect my word!´ (Moses) said: What then is thy case, O Samiri? He replied: I saw what they saw not: so I took a handful (of dust) from the footprint of the Messenger, and threw it (into the calf): thus did my soul suggest to me. (Moses) said: Get thee gone! but thy (punishment) in this life will be that thou wilt say, ´touch me not´; and moreover (for a future penalty) thou hast a promise that will not fail: Now look at thy god, of whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper: We will certainly (melt) it in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea! But the god of you all is the One Allah: there is no god but He: all things He comprehends in His knowledge. Thus do We relate to thee some stories of what happened before: for We have sent thee a Message from Our own Presence. If any do turn away therefrom, verily they will bear a burden on the Day of judgment; They will abide in this (state): and grievous will the burden be to them on that Day,- The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded: that Day, We shall gather the sinful, blear-eyed (with terror). In whispers will they consult each other: Yet tarried not longer than ten (Days); We know best what they will say, when their leader most eminent in conduct will say: Ye tarried not longer than a day! They ask thee concerning the Mountains: say, My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust; He will leave them as plains smooth and level; Nothing crooked or curved wilt thou see in their place. On that Day will they follow the Caller (straight): no crookedness (can they show) him: all sounds shall humble themselves in the Presence of (Allah) Most Gracious: nothing shalt thou hear but the tramp of their feet (as they march). On that Day shall no intercession avail except for those for whom permission has been granted by (Allah) Most Gracious and whose word is acceptable to Him. He knows what (appears to His creatures as) before or after or behind them: but they shall not compass it with their knowledge. (All) faces shall be humbled before (Him) - the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity (on his back). But he who works deeds of righteousness, and has faith, will have no fear of harm nor of any curtailment (of what is his due). Thus have We sent this down - an arabic Qur´an - and explained therein in detail some of the warnings, in order that they may fear Allah, or that it may cause their remembrance (of Him). High above all is Allah, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with the Qur´an before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, O my Lord! advance me in knowledge. We had already, beforehand, taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot: and We found on his part no firm resolve. When We said to the angels, Prostrate yourselves to Adam, they prostrated themselves, but not Iblis: he refused. Then We said: O Adam! verily, this is an enemy to thee and thy wife: so let him not get you both out of the Garden, so that thou art landed in misery. There is therein (enough provision) for thee not to go hungry nor to go naked, Nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun´s heat. But Satan whispered evil to him: he said, O Adam! shall I lead thee to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays? In the result, they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord, and allow himself to be seduced. But his Lord chose him (for His Grace): He turned to him, and gave him Guidance. He said: Get ye down, both of you,- all together, from the Garden, with enmity one to another: but if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from Me, whosoever follows My Guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery. But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life narrowed down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment. He will say: O my Lord! why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I had sight (before)? (Allah) will say: Thus didst Thou, when Our Signs came unto thee, disregard them: so wilt thou, this day, be disregarded. And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the Signs of his Lord: and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far more grievous and more enduring. Is it not a warning to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them We destroyed, in whose haunts they (now) move? Verily, in this are Signs for men endued with understanding. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (their punishment) must necessarily have come; but there is a Term appointed (for respite). Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; yea, celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day: that thou mayest have (spiritual) joy. Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to parties of them, the splendour of the life of this world, through which We test them: but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring. Enjoin prayer on thy people, and be constant therein. We ask thee not to provide sustenance: We provide it for thee. But the (fruit of) the Hereafter is for righteousness. They say: Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord? Has not a Clear Sign come to them of all that was in the former Books of revelation? And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this, they would have said: Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent us a messenger, we should certainly have followed Thy Signs before we were humbled and put to shame. Say: Each one (of us) is waiting: wait ye, therefore, and soon shall ye know who it is that is on the straight and even way, and who it is that has received Guidance. ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Fussilet","Ha Mim: A Revelation from (Allah), Most Gracious, Most Merciful;- A Book, whereof the verses are explained in detail;- a Qur´an in Arabic, for people who understand;- Giving good news and admonition: yet most of them turn away, and so they hear not. They say: Our hearts are under veils, (concealed) from that to which thou dost invite us, and in our ears in a deafness, and between us and thee is a screen: so do thou (what thou wilt); for us, we shall do (what we will!) Say thou: I am but a man like you: It is revealed to me by Inspiration, that your Allah is one Allah: so stand true to Him, and ask for His Forgiveness. And woe to those who join gods with Allah,- Those who practise not regular Charity, and who even deny the Hereafter. For those who believe and work deeds of righteousness is a reward that will never fail. Say: Is it that ye deny Him Who created the earth in two Days? And do ye join equals with Him? He is the Lord of (all) the Worlds. He set on the (earth), mountains standing firm, high above it, and bestowed blessings on the earth, and measure therein all things to give them nourishment in due proportion, in four Days, in accordance with (the needs of) those who seek (Sustenance). Moreover He comprehended in His design the sky, and it had been (as) smoke: He said to it and to the earth: Come ye together, willingly or unwillingly. They said: We do come (together), in willing obedience. So He completed them as seven firmaments in two Days, and He assigned to each heaven its duty and command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights, and (provided it) with guard. Such is the Decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might, Full of Knowledge. But if they turn away, say thou: I have warned you of a stunning Punishment (as of thunder and lightning) like that which (overtook) the ´Ad and the Thamud! Behold, the messengers came to them, from before them and behind them, (preaching): Serve none but Allah. They said, If our Lord had so pleased, He would certainly have sent down angels (to preach). Now we reject your mission (altogether). Now the ´Ad behaved arrogantly through the land, against (all) truth and reason, and said: Who is superior to us in strength? What! did they not see that Allah, Who created them, was superior to them in strength? But they continued to reject Our Signs! So We sent against them a furious Wind through days of disaster, that We might give them a taste of a Penalty of humiliation in this life; but the Penalty of a Hereafter will be more humiliating still: and they will find no help. As to the Thamud, We gave them Guidance, but they preferred blindness (of heart) to Guidance: so the stunning Punishment of humiliation seized them, because of what they had earned. But We delivered those who believed and practised righteousness. On the Day that the enemies of Allah will be gathered together to the Fire, they will be marched in ranks. At length, when they reach the (Fire), their hearing, their sight, and their skins will bear witness against them, as to (all) their deeds. They will say to their skins: Why bear ye witness against us? They will say: Allah hath given us speech,- (He) Who giveth speech to everything: He created you for the first time, and unto Him were ye to return. Ye did not seek to hide yourselves, lest your hearing, your sight, and your skins should bear witness against you! But ye did think that Allah knew not many of the things that ye used to do! But this thought of yours which ye did entertain concerning your Lord, hath brought you to destruction, and (now) have ye become of those utterly lost! If, then, they have patience, the Fire will be a home for them! and if they beg to be received into favour, into favour will they not (then) be received. And We have destined for them intimate companions (of like nature), who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men, who have passed away, is proved against them; for they are utterly lost. The Unbelievers say: Listen not to this Qur´an, but talk at random in the midst of its (reading), that ye may gain the upper hand! But We will certainly give the Unbelievers a taste of a severe Penalty, and We will requite them for the worst of their deeds. Such is the requital of the enemies of Allah,- the Fire: therein will be for them the Eternal Home: a (fit) requital, for that they were wont to reject Our Signs. And the Unbelievers will say: Our Lord! Show us those, among Jinns and men, who misled us: We shall crush them beneath our feet, so that they become the vilest (before all). In the case of those who say, Our Lord is Allah, and, further, stand straight and steadfast, the angels descend on them (from time to time): Fear ye not! (they suggest), Nor grieve! but receive the Glad Tidings of the Garden (of Bliss), the which ye were promised! We are your protectors in this life and in the Hereafter: therein shall ye have all that your souls shall desire; therein shall ye have all that ye ask for!- A hospitable gift from one Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful! Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to Allah, works righteousness, and says, I am of those who bow in Islam? Nor can goodness and Evil be equal. Repel (Evil) with what is better: Then will he between whom and thee was hatred become as it were thy friend and intimate! And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint,- none but persons of the greatest good fortune. And if (at any time) an incitement to discord is made to thee by the Evil One, seek refuge in Allah. He is the One Who hears and knows all things. Among His Signs are the Night and the Day, and the Sun and the Moon. Do not prostrate to the sun and the moon, but prostrate to Allah, Who created them, if it is Him ye wish to serve. But is the (Unbelievers) are arrogant, (no matter): for in the presence of thy Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never flag (nor feel themselves above it). And among His Signs in this: thou seest the earth barren and desolate; but when We send down rain to it, it is stirred to life and yields increase. Truly, He Who gives life to the (dead) earth can surely give life to (men) who are dead. For He has power over all things. Those who pervert the Truth in Our Signs are not hidden from Us. Which is better?- he that is cast into the Fire, or he that comes safe through, on the Day of Judgment? Do what ye will: verily He seeth (clearly) all that ye do. Those who reject the Message when it comes to them (are not hidden from Us). And indeed it is a Book of exalted power. No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: It is sent down by One Full of Wisdom, Worthy of all Praise. Nothing is said to thee that was not said to the messengers before thee: that thy lord has at his Command (all) forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty. Had We sent this as a Qur´an (in the language) other than Arabic, they would have said: Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! (a Book) not in Arabic and (a Messenger an Arab? Say: It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their (eyes): They are (as it were) being called from a place far distant! We certainly gave Moses the Book aforetime: but disputes arose therein. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (their differences) would have been settled between them: but they remained in suspicious disquieting doubt thereon. Whoever works righteousness benefits his own soul; whoever works evil, it is against his own soul: nor is thy Lord ever unjust (in the least) to His Servants. To Him is referred the Knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment: He knows all): No date-fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive (within her womb) nor bring forth the Day that (Allah) will propound to them the (question), Where are the partners (ye attributed to Me? They will say, We do assure thee not one of us can bear witness! The (deities) they used to invoke aforetime will leave them in the lurch, and they will perceive that they have no way of escape. Man does not weary of asking for good (things), but if ill touches him, he gives up all hope (and) is lost in despair. When we give him a taste of some Mercy from Ourselves, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, This is due to my (merit): I think not that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) be established; but if I am brought back to my Lord, I have (much) good (stored) in His sight! But We will show the Unbelievers the truth of all that they did, and We shall give them the taste of a severe Penalty. When We bestow favours on man, he turns away, and gets himself remote on his side (instead of coming to Us); and when evil seizes him, (he comes) full of prolonged prayer! Say: See ye if the (Revelation) is (really) from Allah, and yet do ye reject it? Who is more astray than one who is in a schism far (from any purpose)? Soon will We show them our Signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth), and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord doth witness all things? Ah indeed! Are they in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? Ah indeed! It is He that doth encompass all things!

"Ahkaf","Ha-Mim. The Revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. We created not the heavens and the earth and all between them but for just ends, and for a Term Appointed: But those who reject Faith turn away from that whereof they are warned. Say: Do ye see what it is ye invoke besides Allah? Show me what it is they have created on earth, or have they a share in the heavens bring me a book (revealed) before this, or any remnant of knowledge (ye may have), if ye are telling the truth! And who is more astray than one who invokes besides Allah, such as will not answer him to the Day of Judgment, and who (in fact) are unconscious of their call (to them)? And when mankind are gathered together (at the Resurrection), they will be hostile to them and reject their worship (altogether)! When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say, of the Truth when it comes to them: This is evident sorcery! Or do they say, He has forged it? Say: Had I forged it, then can ye obtain no single (blessing) for me from Allah. He knows best of that whereof ye talk (so glibly)! Enough is He for a witness between me and you! And he is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: I am no bringer of new-fangled doctrine among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I follow but that which is revealed to me by inspiration; I am but a Warner open and clear. Say: See ye? If (this teaching) be from Allah, and ye reject it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity (with earlier scripture), and has believed while ye are arrogant, (how unjust ye are!) truly, Allah guides not a people unjust. The Unbelievers say of those who believe: If (this Message) were a good thing, (such men) would not have gone to it first, before us! And seeing that they guide not themselves thereby, they will say, this is an (old,) falsehood! And before this, was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: And this Book confirms (it) in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust, and as Glad Tidings to those who do right. Verily those who say, Our Lord is Allah, and remain firm (on that Path),- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein (for aye): a recompense for their (good) deeds. We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the (child) to his weaning is (a period of) thirty months. At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years, he says, O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow (to Thee) in Islam. Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass by their ill deeds: (They shall be) among the Companions of the Garden: a promise! of truth, which was made to them (in this life). But (there is one) who says to his parents, Fie on you! Do ye hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up, even though generations have passed before me (without rising again)? And they two seek Allah´s aid, (and rebuke the son): Woe to thee! Have faith! for the promise of Allah is true. But he says, This is nothing but tales of the ancients! Such are they against whom is proved the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men, that have passed away; for they will be (utterly) lost. And to all are (assigned) degrees according to the deeds which they (have done), and in order that (Allah) may recompense their deeds, and no injustice be done to them. And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (It will be said to them): Ye received your good things in the life of the world, and ye took your pleasure out of them: but today shall ye be recompensed with a Penalty of humiliation: for that ye were arrogant on earth without just cause, and that ye (ever) transgressed. Mention (Hud) one of ´Ad´s (own) brethren: Behold, he warned his people about the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and after him: Worship ye none other than Allah: Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Mighty Day. They said: Hast thou come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Then bring upon us the (calamity) with which thou dost threaten us, if thou art telling the truth? He said: The Knowledge (of when it will come) is only with Allah: I proclaim to you the mission on which I have been sent: But I see that ye are a people in ignorance!.. Then, when they saw the (Penalty in the shape of) a cloud traversing the sky, coming to meet their valleys, they said, This cloud will give us rain! Nay, it is the (Calamity) ye were asking to be hastened!- A wind wherein is a Grievous Penalty! Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord! Then by the morning they - nothing was to be seen but (the ruins of) their houses! thus do We recompense those given to sin! And We had firmly established them in a (prosperity and) power which We have not given to you (ye Quraish!) and We had endowed them with (faculties of) hearing, seeing, heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were their (faculties of) hearing, sight, and heart and intellect, when they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah; and they were (completely) encircled by that which they used to mock at! We destroyed aforetime populations round about you; and We have shown the Signs in various ways, that they may turn (to Us). Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped as gods, besides Allah, as a means of access (to Allah)? Nay, they left them in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention. Behold, We turned towards thee a company of Jinns (quietly) listening to the Qur´an: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, Listen in silence! When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people, to warn (them of their sins). They said, O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path. O our people, hearken to the one who invites (you) to Allah, and believe in him: He will forgive you your faults, and deliver you from a Penalty Grievous. If any does not hearken to the one who invites (us) to Allah, he cannot frustrate (Allah´s Plan) on earth, and no protectors can he have besides Allah: such men (wander) in manifest error. See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and never wearied with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yea, verily He has power over all things. And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (they will be asked,) Is this not the Truth? they will say, Yea, by our Lord! (One will say:) Then taste ye the Penalty, for that ye were wont to deny (Truth)! Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) messengers of inflexible purpose; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day.
